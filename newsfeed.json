		"description": "I Will Go is a rallying call to every member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to be part of Total Member Involvement. It is a call to mobilize our resources efficiently and productively, to be flexible, and to answer God's call to put aside our own plans and move in whatever direction He calls us to go.Women's Ministries embraces the Seventh-day Adventist Church's 2020-2025 world themeâ€”I Will Go. We have added to it three words, Reach My World, and it becomes I Will Go Reach My World.Reaching your world is to touch the heart and lives of someone in your center of influence, whether it be your own family, friends, neighborhood, or workplace.Reaching your world is to show and tell the world the good news of the Savio.Our Women's Ministries mission statement emphasizes that we are called to NURTURE our sisters, to EMPOWER them for service, and then to focus all that we have learned on OUTREACH to others.",
