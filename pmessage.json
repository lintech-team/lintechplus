They should become intelligent as to how they can work most successfully and methodically in bringing souls to Christ. Women of firm principle and decided character are needed, women who believe that we are indeed living in the last days, and that we have the last solemn message of warning to be given to the world. They should feel that they are engaged in an important work in spreading the rays of light, which Heaven has shed upon them. When the love of God and His truth is an abiding principle, they will let nothing deter them from duty, or iscourage them in their work. They will fear God, and will not be diverted from their labors in His cause by the temptation of lucrative situations and attractive prospects. They will preserve their integrity at any cost to themselves. These are the ones who will correctly represent the religion of Christ, whose words will be fitly spoken, like apples of gold in pictures of silver. Such persons, in many ways can do a precious work for God. He calls upon them to go out into the harvest field, and help gather in the sheaves.",
