   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 23 - April 18</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Sustained by the Word</strong></p>
	
<p>What ways do you feel God growing and proving your faith? What are some of your favorite Bible promises you like to claim when you are struggling? As a heart challenge this week, why don‚Äôt you find a new Bible verse that gives you courage and memorize it. Then share it with someone who is in need of courage.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCast your burden on the LORD, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.‚Äù Psalms 55:22</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy fellow-laborers, let not your courage fail. God is proving your faith. The Christian always has a strong helper in the Lord. When you come to a pause in your earnest efforts because you are unable to obtain the needed help, cast your burden upon the Lord. Be content to leave it there, certain that He is faithful who has promised. The What and How of the Lord‚Äôs helping we know not; but this we do know, the Lord will never fail those who put their trust in Him. When He has fully proved His workers, He will bring them forth refined as gold tried in the fire.‚Äù Ellen White, Letter 66, June 26, 1901, par. 29</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong> </p>
<p>We praise the Lord that the early projections for massive death rate in the United States as a result of COVID-19 are being lowered quite dramatically. The pandemic is also continuing to slow down throughout Europe, and there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the health professionals on the front lines who are continuing to battle this epidemic. Pray for their health safety from COVID-19, and their physical safety from irrational people on the streets who think medical personnel are contaminated.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that there would be a balance between locking down the whole world at home and opening up the economy and activities at the right time‚Äîas soon as safe so that the economy and businesses are not completely destroyed.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the many organizations, and small businesses who are suffering financially as a result of the lockdown. Pray that people would find ways to help support small businesses so they don‚Äôt go under.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for women and children who are in dangerous situations and need protection. Pray for ways to reach out to the vulnerable and weak in your own community.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who work in banks, grocery stores, gas stations, and other essential businesses. Pray that they would be protected from getting the Coronavirus as they deal with many people coming for services.</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 22 - April 17</p>
<p>üìú <strong> Come, Rest Awhile </strong></p>
			
<p>What is the greatest barrier that stops you from spending quality time with God? Are there blocks you could ask God to help you remove to clear away certain distractions? How might this change your prayer and Bible study habits?</p>

<p>‚ÄúThose who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude‚Ä¶ Our lives may seem a tangle; but as we commit ourselves to the wise Master Worker, He will bring out the pattern of life and character
that will be to His own glory.‚Äù (Desire of Ages, p. 331)</p>

<p><strong>ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE:</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps God is wanting to work through the difficult circumstances around us to help us realize our great need for Him before He returns. He is providing a unique opportunity for us to rest awhile in Him. Will you respond to His invitation? Let‚Äôs claim the promises of John 15:4, 5; Isa. 26:2, 3 and Mark 6:33 while we seek rest and assurance in Him.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT!</strong></p>
<p>In spite of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the Seventh-day Adventist Church continues to move forward in mission. And many creative and new methods of sharing the gospel are being developed with a much broader reach then we‚Äôve yet experienced. Praise the Lord!</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus:</strong> </p>
<p>1.Pray for our church members and those who are grieving the recent loss of loved ones due to COVID-19. Pray for peace and comfort for their hearts. Pray for physical healing for those who are currently battling the Coronavirus.</p>

<p>2. Pray that church members will actively embrace the healthy lifestyle principles of NEWSTART (which stand for Nutrition, Exercise, Water, Sunshine, Temperance, Air, Rest, and Trust in God) as a balanced approach to healthy living.</p>

<p>3. Pray that we as a church will continue to will find ways to effectively share God‚Äôs health message, along with the Three Angels‚Äô messages, which is our last-day mission to the world including our need to plead for the latter rain of the Holy Spirit, as we prepare for Christ's soon second coming.</p>

<p>4. Pray that in our eagerness to find creative ways to witness to others, we don‚Äôt lose our strong emphasis on Christ, His Word, His righteousness, His sanctuary service, and His saving power in the great controversy.</p>

<p>5. Pray for the It Is Written online evangelistic campaign ‚ÄúHope Awakens‚Äù that is launching today nationwide. (To learn more visit: https://www.discoverhopeawakens.com/). Pray that even more people will be able to watch and gain interest in this series than they would have with the LIVE evangelistic event that was cancelled in Indianapolis.</p>

<p><strong>Motivational - "Come, Rest Awhile"</strong></p>
<p>by Nina Atcheson</p>

<p>One beautiful morning, I realized the house was too quiet, and my three-year old daughter was missing. Her brothers were playing together, but she was nowhere to be found. I called out for her, wondering where she could be. ‚ÄúTahlia, where are you?‚Äù My voice echoed through the house, but silence responded. I walked through different rooms, finding no trace of her.</p>

<p>Finally, I heard a tiny voice. ‚ÄúMummy...‚Äù Her little head poked out from behind my red chair. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù she held up our worship book, the page open to a picture of Jesus and His angels descending to earth. ‚ÄúHe comes today, Mummy?‚Äù she asked, pointing to the window beside her.</p>

<p>My heart melted as I realized that she was sitting there, waiting for Jesus to come back today. In my morning rush, I was making breakfast, hanging out washing, and answering the phone instead. The immediacy of these ‚Äòurgent‚Äô chores had completely distracted me from giving any time to Jesus that morning. God couldn‚Äôt have spoken more clearly than through Tahlia at that moment. It was like He was saying, Just slow down and notice Me this morning. I‚Äôm here. And I‚Äôm coming soon! Spend some time with Me‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Today, many years later, I still hear God‚Äôs words to me. ‚ÄúCome aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while‚Äù (Mark 6:31). He invites us to stop, in the maddening rush around us, to be with Him. Not just momentarily or out of obligation, but for a season, because we want to spend time with the Restorer of Our Souls.</p>

<p>Right now, many of us find ourselves in a place where we are isolated in our homes due to a global pandemic. In a sense, we have been forced to pause in our usual rush of life. Our lives have changed for this season. Are we resting in Him in this ‚Äúdeserted place‚Äù? Are we listening to His still small voice (1 Kings 19:12), calling us into a closer walk with Him (John 15:9)? Are we coming aside to know Him more, or are we filling up the quiet space with the noise of other distractions?</p>

<p>As a child, I remember singing a song that included these words: ‚ÄúTime with Him is time well spent. He will be your Comfort and your Guide. Time with Him is time well spent. He will always be right by your side.‚Äù Building our relationship with God by spending time with our Comforter and Guide, is of utmost importance in the times we find ourselves in right now. Quality time (instead of quantity or length of time) is what counts most. What might you do to improve the quality of your time with God this week? Consider the following ideas:</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Ask God to give you a greater desire to spend time with Him.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ The Bible is not meant to be difficult to study. It‚Äôs God‚Äôs living Word to you, and He is waiting to speak to you through it.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Come in humility and pray before you read your Bible, asking God for a specific message that you need to hear.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ You may want to take just one verse or one small bite-size portion of Scripture each day. Consider: What is God telling me through this passage? How can I encourage someone today with this message?</p>
<p>God waits patiently for us to spend time with Him every day (Rev. 3:20). Will you wait expectantly, like Tahlia, longing for His return? Will you come and rest awhile with Him as you wait?</p>

Nina, her husband Matt, and their three children live near the Gold Coast, Australia.</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 21 - April 16</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Let's Talk Faith</strong></p>
			
<p>What does it mean to talk and act in faith? If our faith is weak, how do we grow stronger faith? (See Romans 10:17). Share with someone today an experience where God grew your faith, or tell someone a testimony about an answered prayer.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God.‚Äù Ps. 20:6-7</p>

<p>‚ÄúTake the word of Christ as your assurance. Has He not invited you to come unto Him? Never allow yourself to talk in a hopeless, discouraged way. If you do you will lose much. By looking at appearances and complaining when difficulties and pressure come, you give evidence of a sickly, enfeebled faith. Talk and act as if your faith was invincible. The Lord is rich in resources; He owns the world. Look heavenward in faith. Look to Him who has light and power and efficiency.‚Äù Christ Object Lessons, p. 146</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>We praise the Lord for the health message that He has given us, that enables us to be stronger to fight off sickness and disease. We praise the Lord for the many ways that He‚Äôs enabling us to share this health message with others.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus:</strong></p>
<p>1. Pray that God would continue to help us become a people of strong faith, for we know much more difficult trials lie ahead.</p>

<p>2. Pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon God‚Äôs people so that the work can be finished and we can go home.</p>

<p>3. Pray for wisdom for pastors and administrators as they seek to comfort and encourage and lead in the midst of chaos.</p>

<p>4. Pray that we as a people would do our best to live the health principles we‚Äôve been taught that our body can have strong immune systems.</p>

<p>5. Pray that God‚Äôs love would so fill us, so move us, so break our hearts afresh, that we could not contain it, but would share it with those who have no hope.	</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 20 - April 15</p>
<p>üìú <strong>God is Faithful</strong></p>

<p>Do you feel like you are dealing with more than you can bear? God promises He won‚Äôt give us more than we can bear, so if you feel overwhelmed claim the promise of 1 Cor. 10:13. Claim the promise of Phil. 4:13, and Ps. 61:2. Comfort yourself today in the promises
of God‚Äôs Word.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.‚Äù 1 Cor. 10:13</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe enemy dare not go one hairbreadth beyond his appointed sphere. There is no power in the whole satanic force that can disable the soul that trusts, in simple confidence, in the wisdom that comes from God. Christ is our tower of strength, and Satan can have no power over the soul that walks with God in humility of mind. The promise, ‚ÄúLet him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.‚Äù In Christ there is perfect and complete help for every tempted soul. Dangers beset every path, but the whole universe of heaven is standing on guard, that none may be tempted above that which he is able to bear.‚Äù My Life Today, p. 316</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>Across Europe (and probably many places around the world), young people that haven‚Äôt been going to church are getting active in online Bible study groups. We praise the Lord for this increased interest in God and His Word!</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus:</strong></p>
<p>1. Pray that even more of our youth would be interested in learning to study their Bibles. Pray that there would be a great revival among our youth.</p>

<p>2. Pray for our youth around the world, who are participating in their own 100 Days of Prayer led out by the General Conference Youth Department and Children Ministries department. Pray that our youth and young people would learn that when we pray God hears and answers prayer.</p>

<p>3. Pray for teachers as they struggle to teach classes online. Pray that God would give them wisdom how to utilize technology in away that is beneficial for all. Pray for wisdom and patience.</p>

<p>4. Pray for those that are broken, for those that have recently lost loved ones, and for those struggling in isolation to feel that God is still near.</p>

<p>5. Pray for endurance for doctors, nurses, and health professionals that are on the front lines battling the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 19 - April 14</p>
<p>üìú Topic: <strong>LOOK UP TO JESUS</strong></p>
<p>üí° <strong>Study Verse:</strong> ‚ÄúMy voice You shall hear in the morning, O LORD; In the morning I will direct it to You, And I will look up.‚Äù<strong>(Ps. 5:3)</strong></p>

<p>üîñ <strong>Read:</strong> ‚ÄúSummon all your powers to look up, not down at your difficulties; then you will never faint by the way. You will soon see Jesus behind the cloud, reaching out His hand to help you; and all you have to do is to give Him your hand in simple faith and let Him lead you. As you become trustful you will, through faith in Jesus, become hopeful. The light shining from the cross of Calvary will reveal to you God‚Äôs estimate of the soul, and, appreciating that estimate, you will seek to reflect the light to the world. A great name among men is as letters traced in sand, but a spotless character will endure to all eternity.‚Äù <strong>(Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 578)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>What is the first thing that you do each morning? Do you look at the news, your e-mails or social media? Do you start thinking about all your problems? Or do you look up to Jesus? As you go through today, make a new commitment to look to Jesus instead of looking down on your trials. Look to Jesus for hope instead of turning to the secular world for encouragement.</p>

<p><strong>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</strong></p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus (Day 19)</strong></p>

<p><strong>FIRST A PRAISE REPORT:</strong> </p>
<p>In the last thirty days, over a hundred thousand resources have been downloaded from www.revivalandreformation.org. We praise the Lord that many people are recognizing their spiritual need and seeking to grow in their walk with God. We also praise the Lord that thousands of prayer groups are starting all around the world as a result of this COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members throughout Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Belgium. These hot spot areas are still struggling to curtail the virus. Pray for healing for those who have experienced loss.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members throughout the Middle East, especially in Iran and Israel. Pray for those that are living cramped up in tiny compartments with little fresh air and no ability to get exercise.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for your neighbors who may not know Jesus. Pray for ways to share the hope of Jesus with them, maybe through ‚Äúcell phone‚Äù evangelism or other helpful online resources. </p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for those in your own church or community who are fighting COVID-19 right now. Pray for God‚Äôs healing hand to be upon them.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that we would all be faithful stewards and return our tithe. Even though times are difficult the Bible tells us that those who honor God, He will honor <strong>(1 Sam. 2:30)</strong>.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 18 - April 13</p>
<p>üìú Looking Beyond what is Seen</p>

<p>‚ÄúJesus said to him, ‚ÄòThomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.‚Äô ‚Äù John 20:29

‚ÄúOften the Christian life is beset with dangers, and duty seems hard to perform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before, and bondage and death behind. Yet the voice of God speaks clearly, Go forward. Let us obey the command, even though our sight cannot penetrate the darkness.

The obstacles that hinder our progress will never disappear before a halting, doubting spirit. Those who defer obedience till every uncertainty disappears, and there remains no risk of failure or defeat, will never obey. Faith looks beyond the difficulties, and lays hold of the unseen, even Omnipotence, therefore it cannot be baffled. Faith is the clasping of the hand of Christ in every emergency.‚Äù Gospel Workers, p. 262

Heart Questions.
It is easy to believe what we see, but what about the things we cannot see? What are ways that we can grow our faith in God‚Äôs Word, even though we have not yet seen its fulfillment? We are told Faith is a gift. Based on Ephesians 2:8 and Acts 3:16,
where do we get this amazing gift?


PRAISE REPORT: 
In Papua New Guinea outside evangelists, pastors, and lay preachers can no longer travel into the country, due to COVID-19 travel bans, for the previously scheduled Total Member Involvement event that was suppose to take place this May. However, the local people in Papua New Guinea had already been rallying together this past year holding tens of thousands of Bible studies, and initiating thousands of local meetings held by lay people and pastors. And they are already making plans for another big evangelistic thrust to follow after the current COVID-19 pandemic has passed. Again, what the enemy has meant for evil, God is turning to even greater good.

Prayer Focus
1. Pray for God's protection over the people and country of Papua New Guinea and also for God's leading in decision making for the PNG Government and its health professionals as they battle COVID-19.

2. Pray that what God does in Papua New Guinea through the local church members would be even more successful than the original plans that were made. Pray that there will be no tribal fighting as plans are made to move forward.

3. Pray for believers who are incarcerated in different prisons around the world. Pray for strength to witness to fellow inmates during this crisis.

4. Pray for a small bakery and mission center in J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden to reach even more people, so that many will come know Jesus and accept Him as their Savior. Pray for more Bible study contacts and conversions.

5. Pray also for the local churches throughout Sweden, which are small and composed of mostly elderly people. Pray that God would bring more young people into the churches in Scandinavia, and that He would protect these small congregations during this COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 17 - April 12</p>
<p>‚ÄúCall upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.‚Äù Ps. 50:15</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe greatest victories gained for the cause of God are not the result of labored argument, ample facilities, wide influence, or abundance of means; they are gained in the audience chamber with God, when with earnest, agonizing faith men lay hold upon the
mighty arm of power.‚Äù Gospel Workers, p. 259</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Since we know that we gain our greatest victories through prayer and time in God‚Äôs Word, why are we so hesitant to take the time to pray and study the Bible? What activities or distractions are getting in the way of your personal communion with God?</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>
<p>1 PRAISE REPORT: In the Queensland city of Toowoomba (population 130,000), there are two churches, Toowoomba Central and Glenvale. Pastor Casey Wolverton is the pastor of the Glenvale Church. When the COVID19 virus hit and churches were closed, on the first Sabbath, they conducted the worship service as normal but with no one in the pews and broadcast it on Facebook or Youtube and 900 people viewed the service. The local radio station heard what the Adventists were doing, so the radio station approached the Adventist Church asking if they could record the Adventist service and broadcast it the next day (Sunday) to an audience of 130,000 people. Without the COVID-19 crisis it is very unlikely that this would have happened. Praise God!</p>

<p>2. Pray that special messages of hope can continue to be broadcasted throughout the city of Toowoomba in Queensland Australia. Pray for church members throughout Australia, that they can find ways to continue to be a light to those around them.</p>

<p>3. Pray for our many Literature Evangelists around the world that can no longer go door to door. Pray for God to open up new ways for these dedicated workers to share the truth. And pray that God would provide for their needs.</p>

<p>4. Pray for hospitals across the United States who are expecting to have their most difficult week yet in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Pray for God to intervene.</p>

<p>5. Pray for the elderly, the immune-compromised, and other high-risk members in your local church. Pray that God‚Äôs protecting hand would be around them.</p>

<p>6. Pray for those who have already lost loved ones because of this Coronavirus outbreak. Pray for courage and strength for those experiencing loss to hold on to God.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 16 - April 11</p>
  <p>‚ÄúCall to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.‚Äù Jeremiah. 33:3</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe have come to serious times. Events in our world call upon every follower of Christ to be totally in earnest in our relationship with God. To strengthen this relationship and satisfy our emotional and spiritual needs, we must learn the power of prayer. We must plead with the Lord, like the disciples of old, saying, ‚ÄòLord, teach us to pray.‚Äô ‚Äù Prayer, p. 1</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>We may be part of 100 Days of Prayer, and we may be praying with our small prayer groups, but have we really learned what it means to pray? Have we ever earnestly cried out like the disciples cried to Jesus, ‚ÄúLord, teach us to pray?‚Äù If you haven‚Äôt done this, why don‚Äôt you ask the Lord today, ‚ÄúPlease teach me to pray!‚Äù</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>
<p>1. PRAISE REPORT: Although Indianapolis had to cancel the large evangelistic meetings planned pre-GC session, now John Bradshaw is planning to do a series of meetings online which we believe will have much greater reach. We expect tens of thousands of people to attend. Once again, what the enemy has meant for evil, God is turning around for good.</p>

<p>2. Pray that we as a church would ask God to send the Holy Spirit and teach us how to pray in a way that we will receive answers.</p>

<p>3. Pray for the online evangelistic series that John Bradshaw and It is Written is planning. Pray that many people will tune in and that many will make decisions for Jesus.</p>

<p>4. Pray for medical professionals and hospitals in your area that are struggling with a shortage of medically supplies. Pray that God would provide what is needed so our health professionals can stay safe.</p>

<p>5. Pray that more people will make masks and other protective equipment, and that the needed beds, ventilators, and health facilities would be opened to accommodate the surge in medical care needed.</p>

<p>6. Pray for the Chinese ministry in Cebu City in the Philippines. Pray for protection from the Coronavirus for the church there and that more Chinese people will take an active interest in the study of the Scriptures.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>‚ÄúHow can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your word. With my whole heart I have sought You; Oh, let me not wander from Your commandments! Your word I have hidden in my heart, That I might not sin against You.‚Äù Ps. 119:9-11</p>

<p>*HEART QUESTIONS*: While we know that it is always God‚Äôs will to heal His children, we don‚Äôt always know His will regarding timing. Some He might choose to heal immediately, others gradually, while others He may not heal until the second coming (James 5). Can we trust God and His timing? Can we hold on in faith even when we don‚Äôt always see immediate answers to our prayers? How can we grow our faith and trust in God and His Word?</p>

<p>*ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE*: This week, as we continue to pray for the sick, for the medical professionals, and for God to stop the spread of the Coronavirus around the world, let‚Äôs pray that a love for God and His Word would spread. Let‚Äôs open our Bibles with new enthusiasm and pray, ‚ÄúLord, show us how to know You and love You! Show us how to experience true healing from the inside out. Show us what it means to study and understand Your Word. And show us how to share Your Word with others.‚Äù As we pray, let‚Äôs claim Isa. 55:8-11, 2 Tim. 2:15, and 1 Pet. 3:15.</p>

<p>‚Äì Prayer Focus ‚Äì</p>

<p>PRAISE REPORT! It appears that the spread of the pandemic is starting to slow down a little in Spain and Italy. We praise God that there is hope for improvement.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that God would stop the spread of COVID19 in the countries of the world with high concentrated populations. Pray especially for the Lord‚Äôs intervention in India, Bangladesh, the continent of Africa, and some countries throughout Asia that are just beginning to battle the COVID-19 pandemic in full force.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for medical researchers to find treatments that cure the Coronavirus as we don‚Äôt have months to wait for the development of a vaccine.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God‚Äôs protection for children, for the weak, and vulnerable, who are forced to stay home with abusive family members or who live in difficult foster homes.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for provision for food and meals for children that can no longer attend school where food was regularly provided.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that we would learn to study God‚Äôs Word on a deeper level, and also share His Word in practical ways with those around us.</p>

<p>Motivational - *An Unexpected Miracle*</p>

<p>By James L. Black, Sr.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave you ever seen anything like this?‚Äù This becomes a common question when people witness something they have never seen before. No doubt the name ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù will go down in history as one of the world‚Äôs greatest pandemics.</p>

<p>It is amazing how quickly life can change overnight. The word of God reminds us that disasters will come, and we should always be prepared and dependent upon the Lord. This world crisis has ripped the core out of the economy; overwhelmed medical systems; left many in greater poverty; left many homeless and jobless; left many with permanent illnesses; and yes, it has claimed the lives of tens of thousands.</p>

<p>Many are praying for a miracle. Many are pleading with God to change their situation and protect them from the deadly virus. But the question is, are we prepared for the kind of miracles God performs?</p>

<p>I have no doubt that God will hear and come through for everyone who prays to Him. While He comes through in different ways and in His own time, these promises give me hope. ‚ÄúNo man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you‚Äù (Joshua 1:5), and ‚ÄúIt shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear‚Äù (Isaiah 65:24).</p>

<p>Several years ago, I developed a bone marrow disease called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a depletion of the body‚Äôs red blood cells. If left untreated, MDS leads to Acute leukemia or death. I was at stage 4 of the disease, and my only hope was a successful bone marrow (stem cell) transplant. Thousands around the world were praying for my survival and recovery at a time when I was too weak to sincerely pray for myself. Yes, I can testify that God came through for me, but not in the expected way, for God‚Äôs miracles are about eternal life.</p>

<p>Three things happened that revealed the Lord to me in ways I had not experienced before. First, due to circumstances beyond my control, my transplant process was delayed for nine months even though I was at stage 4 of the disease. This delay provided the opportunity for aggressive wholistic, natural treatments that strengthened my body and better prepared me for the transplant. Second, my daughter (my stem cell donor) and I were able to bond prior to the transplant, leading to an incredible moment of forgiveness. The third was what it did for me and my wife. For the first time in our marriage, I was on my back in the hospital, with a life threatening disease, in isolation, and with chronic fatigue. I was too weak to bathe, so on three or four occasions my wife Maxine had to bathe me. At first I was angry, but when I saw her gentleness and total commitment as she showered me from head to toe, I realized that God was preparing me for a special miracle of healing.</p>

<p>My special miracle is found in these words of Jesus: ‚ÄúWhen Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, ‚ÄòSon, your sins are forgiven you.‚Äô‚Äù Yes, the miracle in my greatest time of need was that God healed me before the transplant. By the grace of God, I walked out of the hospital a new creature in Jesus and healed of a spiritual and physical disease.</p>

<p>Today, I encourage you to take your eyes off of COVID-19 and anything else that may be distracting you, and like the four friends who brought the paralytic to Jesus, tear off the roof, come before Jesus and let Him heal your soul.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear‚Äù (Isaiah 65:24).</p>

<p>Pastor James L. Black, Sr. most recently served 17 years in the North American Division as the youth/young adult ministries director. He is currently director for the North American Division Prayer Ministries.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 14 - April 9</p>
<p>üìú Purified through the Fire</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.‚Äù Rom. 8:18</p>

<p>‚ÄúThrough trial and persecution the glory‚Äîthe character‚Äîof God is revealed in His chosen ones. The believers in Christ, hated and persecuted by the world, are educated and disciplined in the school of Christ. On earth they walk in narrow paths; they are purified in the furnace of affliction. They follow Christ through sore conflicts; they endure self-denial and experience bitter disappointments; but thus they learn the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with abhorrence. Being partakers of Christ‚Äôs sufferings, they can look beyond the gloom to the glory, saying, ‚ÄòI reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.‚Äô Romans 8:18.‚Äù Acts of the Apostles, p. 576</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What is the glory that Romans 8:18 speaks of? Why are trials and suffering helpful to purify us? What have you learned about yourself through the trials of the recent weeks? Do you recognize weak spots in your character that you didn‚Äôt realize you had? How are you praying that God would grow you during this difficult time?</p>

<p>Day 14 - Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1. Pray for heavenly vision that we can see beyond the grave, beyond the pain and suffering and hardship of this life, to see the heavenly reward that awaits those that are faithful to the end.</p>

<p>2. Pray for wisdom for pastors and administrators as they seek to comfort and encourage and lead in the midst of chaos.</p>

<p>3. Pray for our children that are out of school, and especially for those who relied on the meals that they received at school. Pray that God would raise up caring Christians to find ways to feed them during this time of crisis.</p>

<p>4. Pray that God‚Äôs love would so fill us, so move us, so break our hearts afresh, that we could not contain it, but would share it with those who have no hope.</p>

<p>5. Pray that we will understand and actively share the message of ‚ÄúRighteousness by Faith‚Äù and that we will rest in the righteousness of Jesus.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 13 - April 8</p>
<p>üìú OUR EYES ARE UPON YOU!</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúO our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.‚Äù(2 Chron. 20:12)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúGod would not have us remain pressed down by dumb sorrow, with sore and breaking hearts. He would have us look up and behold His dear face of love. The blessed Saviour stands by many whose eyes are so blinded by tears that they do not discern Him. He longs to clasp our hands, to have us look to Him in simple faith, permitting Him to guide us. His heart is open to our griefs, our sorrows, and our trials. He has loved us with an everlasting love and with loving-kindness compassed us about‚Ä¶Think of this, children of suffering and sorrow, and rejoice in hope. ‚ÄòThis is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.‚Äô (1 John 5:4).‚Äù Thoughts from the Mount of Blessings, p. 12</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What does it mean to keep our eyes on Jesus? What happens sometimes when our eyes are blinded by tears? What is God longing to do? Just as God‚Äôs heart is open to our sorrows and grief, so our heart should be open to the sorrow and grief of others. How can we extend His arm of compassion and tender sympathy to those around us today?</p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for those that are broken, for those that have recently lost loved ones, and for those struggling to feel that God is still near. </p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members facing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic across the country of Canada. Pray for strength and peace, and healing. Pray for spiritual revival and that the gospel will advance throughout Canada as a result of these challenging times. </p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 12 - April 7</p>
<p>üìú Topic: GOD'S COVENANT WITH US</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúIf My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.‚Äù(2 Chron. 7:14)</p>

<p>üîñRead: ‚ÄúThe members of our churches need to be converted, to become more spiritual-minded. A chain of earnest, praying believers should encircle the world. Let all pray in humility. A few neighbors may meet together to pray for the Holy Spirit. Let those who cannot leave home, gather in their children, and unite in learning to pray together. They may claim the promise of the Saviour: ‚ÄòWhere two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.‚Äô ‚Äù Review and Herald, January 3, 1907, par. 4</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Based on 2 Chronicles 7:14 we see that God is looking for a heart of humility and repentance. Why is a spirit of humility so important when we pray? Why is united prayer important? How can we experience united prayer even while apart? </p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus (Day 12)</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that we would know as a church what it means to walk in humility before God and before each other. Pray that He would teach us how to pray, how to repent, and that healing would come as we seek God with all our hearts.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that God would help us as a people know what it means to be more spiritually minded, and how to create a chain of prayer around the world.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members living in the South England Conference in London. Pray that rather than this pandemic discouraging church members, there would be church growth, increased commitment to God and service.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for our youth across Europe, to come back to church, and for parents to be strong positive role models by bringing their children to church. </p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that every person, no matter their age, their gender, their official title or status, would recognize that they are to be witnesses and messengers of God‚Äôs love to a dying world.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 11 - April 6</p>
<p> üìú Topic: GOD'S RAINBOW OF ASSURANCE</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.‚Äù(Matt. 7:7-8)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúThe rainbow round about the throne is an assurance that God is true, that in Him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. We have sinned against Him, and are undeserving of His favor; yet He Himself has put into our lips that most wonderful of pleas, ‚ÄòDo not abhor us, for Thy name‚Äôs sake; do not disgrace the throne of Thy glory; remember, break not Thy covenant with us.‚Äô Jeremiah 14:21. When we come to Him confessing our unworthiness and sin, He has pledged Himself to give heed to our cry. The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His Word unto us.‚Äù Christ Object Lessons, p. 148 </p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Reflect on the three different types of prayer as seen in Matthew 7:7-8. What is the significance of the rainbow around God‚Äôs throne? What is God‚Äôs pledge to us? What is staked against the honor of His throne? How does this give you confidence today?</p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the ongoing health crisis throughout the United States and Europe. Pray that medical professionals can get the adequate supplies that are needed.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for health professionals, security workers, and essential government service personnel across the United States and around the world who have contracted COVID-19 while in the line of duty and service to others. Pray for healing for them.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for those living alone during this health pandemic, those struggling with fear, and those feeling the pain of isolation. Pray that they would discover they are not alone but that Jesus is right by their side.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for all churches in your local region that may have been closed because of the virus. Pray that congregations will find ways to stay ‚Äútogether‚Äù through internet live-streaming and witnessing in appropriate ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù ways, and that many more will be drawn to the truth because of this time of crisis.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for that God would re-ignite fresh passion in the hearts of His people‚Äîfresh passion for His Word, for prayer, and for mission!</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 10 - April 5</p>
<p>üìú Topic: HIDDEN IN HIS TABERNACLE</p>

<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúFor in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.‚Äù_ (Psalms 27:5)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúGod will do great things for those who trust in Him. The reason why His professed people have no greater strength is that they trust so much to their own wisdom, and do not give the Lord an opportunity to reveal His power in their behalf. He will help His believing children in every emergency if they will place their entire confidence in Him and faithfully obey Him.‚Äù _Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 493_</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What does it mean to be hidden in the secret of His tabernacle? Why do we as Christians have so little spiritual strength? What are two actions that God is waiting to see in us? How can we practice these two actions right now during our present crisis?</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Seven</p>
  <p>What type of faith do we need to have? And how are our greatest victories gained? Share with a loved one some 
  victories you have gained recently, or some victories that you need to gain. Pray for one another personally! </p>

  <p>‚ÄúCall upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you and you shall glorify Me.‚Äù Ps. 50:15</p>

<p>‚ÄúJacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His experience testifies to the power of 
importunate prayer. It is now that we are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of unyielding faith. 
The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual Christian are not those that are gained by 
talent or education, by wealth or the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience 
chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power.‚Äù 
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 203</p>

  <p>Day Six</p>
  <p>We are all in a very serious battle. Doctors and nurses and medical professionals on the front line are especially 
  feeling the heat of this battle. How can we encourage them in their work? How are we to fight our battles? And what 
  is the holy calling that the church must awake to in the spiritual realm? </p>

<p>‚ÄúAs for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD shall save me. Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry 
   aloud, and He shall hear my voice. He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there 
   were many against me.‚Äù Ps. 55:16-18 </p>
 
<p>‚ÄúWhen the church awakes to the sense of her holy calling, many more fervent and effective prayers will ascend to
   heaven for the Holy Spirit to point out the
