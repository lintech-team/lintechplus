  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 19 - April 14</p>
<p>üìú Topic: <strong>LOOK UP TO JESUS</strong></p>
<p>üí° <strong>Study Verse:</strong> ‚ÄúMy voice You shall hear in the morning, O LORD; In the morning I will direct it to You, And I will look up.‚Äù<strong>(Ps. 5:3)</strong></p>

<p>üîñ <strong>Read:</strong> ‚ÄúSummon all your powers to look up, not down at your difficulties; then you will never faint by the way. You will soon see Jesus behind the cloud, reaching out His hand to help you; and all you have to do is to give Him your hand in simple faith and let Him lead you. As you become trustful you will, through faith in Jesus, become hopeful. The light shining from the cross of Calvary will reveal to you God‚Äôs estimate of the soul, and, appreciating that estimate, you will seek to reflect the light to the world. A great name among men is as letters traced in sand, but a spotless character will endure to all eternity.‚Äù <strong>(Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 578)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>What is the first thing that you do each morning? Do you look at the news, your e-mails or social media? Do you start thinking about all your problems? Or do you look up to Jesus? As you go through today, make a new commitment to look to Jesus instead of looking down on your trials. Look to Jesus for hope instead of turning to the secular world for encouragement.</p>

<p><strong>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</strong></p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus (Day 19)</strong></p>

<p><strong>FIRST A PRAISE REPORT:</strong> </p>
<p>In the last thirty days, over a hundred thousand resources have been downloaded from www.revivalandreformation.org. We praise the Lord that many people are recognizing their spiritual need and seeking to grow in their walk with God. We also praise the Lord that thousands of prayer groups are starting all around the world as a result of this COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members throughout Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Belgium. These hot spot areas are still struggling to curtail the virus. Pray for healing for those who have experienced loss.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members throughout the Middle East, especially in Iran and Israel. Pray for those that are living cramped up in tiny compartments with little fresh air and no ability to get exercise.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for your neighbors who may not know Jesus. Pray for ways to share the hope of Jesus with them, maybe through ‚Äúcell phone‚Äù evangelism or other helpful online resources. </p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for those in your own church or community who are fighting COVID-19 right now. Pray for God‚Äôs healing hand to be upon them.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that we would all be faithful stewards and return our tithe. Even though times are difficult the Bible tells us that those who honor God, He will honor <strong>(1 Sam. 2:30)</strong>.</p>

<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 18 - April 13</p>
<p>üìú Looking Beyond what is Seen</p>

<p>‚ÄúJesus said to him, ‚ÄòThomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.‚Äô ‚Äù John 20:29

‚ÄúOften the Christian life is beset with dangers, and duty seems hard to perform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before, and bondage and death behind. Yet the voice of God speaks clearly, Go forward. Let us obey the command, even though our sight cannot penetrate the darkness.

The obstacles that hinder our progress will never disappear before a halting, doubting spirit. Those who defer obedience till every uncertainty disappears, and there remains no risk of failure or defeat, will never obey. Faith looks beyond the difficulties, and lays hold of the unseen, even Omnipotence, therefore it cannot be baffled. Faith is the clasping of the hand of Christ in every emergency.‚Äù Gospel Workers, p. 262

Heart Questions.
It is easy to believe what we see, but what about the things we cannot see? What are ways that we can grow our faith in God‚Äôs Word, even though we have not yet seen its fulfillment? We are told Faith is a gift. Based on Ephesians 2:8 and Acts 3:16,
where do we get this amazing gift?


PRAISE REPORT: 
In Papua New Guinea outside evangelists, pastors, and lay preachers can no longer travel into the country, due to COVID-19 travel bans, for the previously scheduled Total Member Involvement event that was suppose to take place this May. However, the local people in Papua New Guinea had already been rallying together this past year holding tens of thousands of Bible studies, and initiating thousands of local meetings held by lay people and pastors. And they are already making plans for another big evangelistic thrust to follow after the current COVID-19 pandemic has passed. Again, what the enemy has meant for evil, God is turning to even greater good.

Prayer Focus
1. Pray for God's protection over the people and country of Papua New Guinea and also for God's leading in decision making for the PNG Government and its health professionals as they battle COVID-19.

2. Pray that what God does in Papua New Guinea through the local church members would be even more successful than the original plans that were made. Pray that there will be no tribal fighting as plans are made to move forward.

3. Pray for believers who are incarcerated in different prisons around the world. Pray for strength to witness to fellow inmates during this crisis.

4. Pray for a small bakery and mission center in J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden to reach even more people, so that many will come know Jesus and accept Him as their Savior. Pray for more Bible study contacts and conversions.

5. Pray also for the local churches throughout Sweden, which are small and composed of mostly elderly people. Pray that God would bring more young people into the churches in Scandinavia, and that He would protect these small congregations during this COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 17 - April 12</p>
<p>‚ÄúCall upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.‚Äù Ps. 50:15</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe greatest victories gained for the cause of God are not the result of labored argument, ample facilities, wide influence, or abundance of means; they are gained in the audience chamber with God, when with earnest, agonizing faith men lay hold upon the
mighty arm of power.‚Äù Gospel Workers, p. 259</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Since we know that we gain our greatest victories through prayer and time in God‚Äôs Word, why are we so hesitant to take the time to pray and study the Bible? What activities or distractions are getting in the way of your personal communion with God?</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>
<p>1 PRAISE REPORT: In the Queensland city of Toowoomba (population 130,000), there are two churches, Toowoomba Central and Glenvale. Pastor Casey Wolverton is the pastor of the Glenvale Church. When the COVID19 virus hit and churches were closed, on the first Sabbath, they conducted the worship service as normal but with no one in the pews and broadcast it on Facebook or Youtube and 900 people viewed the service. The local radio station heard what the Adventists were doing, so the radio station approached the Adventist Church asking if they could record the Adventist service and broadcast it the next day (Sunday) to an audience of 130,000 people. Without the COVID-19 crisis it is very unlikely that this would have happened. Praise God!</p>

<p>2. Pray that special messages of hope can continue to be broadcasted throughout the city of Toowoomba in Queensland Australia. Pray for church members throughout Australia, that they can find ways to continue to be a light to those around them.</p>

<p>3. Pray for our many Literature Evangelists around the world that can no longer go door to door. Pray for God to open up new ways for these dedicated workers to share the truth. And pray that God would provide for their needs.</p>

<p>4. Pray for hospitals across the United States who are expecting to have their most difficult week yet in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Pray for God to intervene.</p>

<p>5. Pray for the elderly, the immune-compromised, and other high-risk members in your local church. Pray that God‚Äôs protecting hand would be around them.</p>

<p>6. Pray for those who have already lost loved ones because of this Coronavirus outbreak. Pray for courage and strength for those experiencing loss to hold on to God.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 16 - April 11</p>
  <p>‚ÄúCall to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.‚Äù Jeremiah. 33:3</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe have come to serious times. Events in our world call upon every follower of Christ to be totally in earnest in our relationship with God. To strengthen this relationship and satisfy our emotional and spiritual needs, we must learn the power of prayer. We must plead with the Lord, like the disciples of old, saying, ‚ÄòLord, teach us to pray.‚Äô ‚Äù Prayer, p. 1</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>We may be part of 100 Days of Prayer, and we may be praying with our small prayer groups, but have we really learned what it means to pray? Have we ever earnestly cried out like the disciples cried to Jesus, ‚ÄúLord, teach us to pray?‚Äù If you haven‚Äôt done this, why don‚Äôt you ask the Lord today, ‚ÄúPlease teach me to pray!‚Äù</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>
<p>1. PRAISE REPORT: Although Indianapolis had to cancel the large evangelistic meetings planned pre-GC session, now John Bradshaw is planning to do a series of meetings online which we believe will have much greater reach. We expect tens of thousands of people to attend. Once again, what the enemy has meant for evil, God is turning around for good.</p>

<p>2. Pray that we as a church would ask God to send the Holy Spirit and teach us how to pray in a way that we will receive answers.</p>

<p>3. Pray for the online evangelistic series that John Bradshaw and It is Written is planning. Pray that many people will tune in and that many will make decisions for Jesus.</p>

<p>4. Pray for medical professionals and hospitals in your area that are struggling with a shortage of medically supplies. Pray that God would provide what is needed so our health professionals can stay safe.</p>

<p>5. Pray that more people will make masks and other protective equipment, and that the needed beds, ventilators, and health facilities would be opened to accommodate the surge in medical care needed.</p>

<p>6. Pray for the Chinese ministry in Cebu City in the Philippines. Pray for protection from the Coronavirus for the church there and that more Chinese people will take an active interest in the study of the Scriptures.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>‚ÄúHow can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your word. With my whole heart I have sought You; Oh, let me not wander from Your commandments! Your word I have hidden in my heart, That I might not sin against You.‚Äù Ps. 119:9-11</p>

<p>*HEART QUESTIONS*: While we know that it is always God‚Äôs will to heal His children, we don‚Äôt always know His will regarding timing. Some He might choose to heal immediately, others gradually, while others He may not heal until the second coming (James 5). Can we trust God and His timing? Can we hold on in faith even when we don‚Äôt always see immediate answers to our prayers? How can we grow our faith and trust in God and His Word?</p>

<p>*ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE*: This week, as we continue to pray for the sick, for the medical professionals, and for God to stop the spread of the Coronavirus around the world, let‚Äôs pray that a love for God and His Word would spread. Let‚Äôs open our Bibles with new enthusiasm and pray, ‚ÄúLord, show us how to know You and love You! Show us how to experience true healing from the inside out. Show us what it means to study and understand Your Word. And show us how to share Your Word with others.‚Äù As we pray, let‚Äôs claim Isa. 55:8-11, 2 Tim. 2:15, and 1 Pet. 3:15.</p>

<p>‚Äì Prayer Focus ‚Äì</p>

<p>PRAISE REPORT! It appears that the spread of the pandemic is starting to slow down a little in Spain and Italy. We praise God that there is hope for improvement.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that God would stop the spread of COVID19 in the countries of the world with high concentrated populations. Pray especially for the Lord‚Äôs intervention in India, Bangladesh, the continent of Africa, and some countries throughout Asia that are just beginning to battle the COVID-19 pandemic in full force.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for medical researchers to find treatments that cure the Coronavirus as we don‚Äôt have months to wait for the development of a vaccine.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God‚Äôs protection for children, for the weak, and vulnerable, who are forced to stay home with abusive family members or who live in difficult foster homes.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for provision for food and meals for children that can no longer attend school where food was regularly provided.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that we would learn to study God‚Äôs Word on a deeper level, and also share His Word in practical ways with those around us.</p>

<p>Motivational - *An Unexpected Miracle*</p>

<p>By James L. Black, Sr.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave you ever seen anything like this?‚Äù This becomes a common question when people witness something they have never seen before. No doubt the name ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù will go down in history as one of the world‚Äôs greatest pandemics.</p>

<p>It is amazing how quickly life can change overnight. The word of God reminds us that disasters will come, and we should always be prepared and dependent upon the Lord. This world crisis has ripped the core out of the economy; overwhelmed medical systems; left many in greater poverty; left many homeless and jobless; left many with permanent illnesses; and yes, it has claimed the lives of tens of thousands.</p>

<p>Many are praying for a miracle. Many are pleading with God to change their situation and protect them from the deadly virus. But the question is, are we prepared for the kind of miracles God performs?</p>

<p>I have no doubt that God will hear and come through for everyone who prays to Him. While He comes through in different ways and in His own time, these promises give me hope. ‚ÄúNo man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you‚Äù (Joshua 1:5), and ‚ÄúIt shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear‚Äù (Isaiah 65:24).</p>

<p>Several years ago, I developed a bone marrow disease called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a depletion of the body‚Äôs red blood cells. If left untreated, MDS leads to Acute leukemia or death. I was at stage 4 of the disease, and my only hope was a successful bone marrow (stem cell) transplant. Thousands around the world were praying for my survival and recovery at a time when I was too weak to sincerely pray for myself. Yes, I can testify that God came through for me, but not in the expected way, for God‚Äôs miracles are about eternal life.</p>

<p>Three things happened that revealed the Lord to me in ways I had not experienced before. First, due to circumstances beyond my control, my transplant process was delayed for nine months even though I was at stage 4 of the disease. This delay provided the opportunity for aggressive wholistic, natural treatments that strengthened my body and better prepared me for the transplant. Second, my daughter (my stem cell donor) and I were able to bond prior to the transplant, leading to an incredible moment of forgiveness. The third was what it did for me and my wife. For the first time in our marriage, I was on my back in the hospital, with a life threatening disease, in isolation, and with chronic fatigue. I was too weak to bathe, so on three or four occasions my wife Maxine had to bathe me. At first I was angry, but when I saw her gentleness and total commitment as she showered me from head to toe, I realized that God was preparing me for a special miracle of healing.</p>

<p>My special miracle is found in these words of Jesus: ‚ÄúWhen Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, ‚ÄòSon, your sins are forgiven you.‚Äô‚Äù Yes, the miracle in my greatest time of need was that God healed me before the transplant. By the grace of God, I walked out of the hospital a new creature in Jesus and healed of a spiritual and physical disease.</p>

<p>Today, I encourage you to take your eyes off of COVID-19 and anything else that may be distracting you, and like the four friends who brought the paralytic to Jesus, tear off the roof, come before Jesus and let Him heal your soul.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear‚Äù (Isaiah 65:24).</p>

<p>Pastor James L. Black, Sr. most recently served 17 years in the North American Division as the youth/young adult ministries director. He is currently director for the North American Division Prayer Ministries.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 14 - April 9</p>
<p>üìú Purified through the Fire</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.‚Äù Rom. 8:18</p>

<p>‚ÄúThrough trial and persecution the glory‚Äîthe character‚Äîof God is revealed in His chosen ones. The believers in Christ, hated and persecuted by the world, are educated and disciplined in the school of Christ. On earth they walk in narrow paths; they are purified in the furnace of affliction. They follow Christ through sore conflicts; they endure self-denial and experience bitter disappointments; but thus they learn the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with abhorrence. Being partakers of Christ‚Äôs sufferings, they can look beyond the gloom to the glory, saying, ‚ÄòI reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.‚Äô Romans 8:18.‚Äù Acts of the Apostles, p. 576</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What is the glory that Romans 8:18 speaks of? Why are trials and suffering helpful to purify us? What have you learned about yourself through the trials of the recent weeks? Do you recognize weak spots in your character that you didn‚Äôt realize you had? How are you praying that God would grow you during this difficult time?</p>

<p>Day 14 - Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1. Pray for heavenly vision that we can see beyond the grave, beyond the pain and suffering and hardship of this life, to see the heavenly reward that awaits those that are faithful to the end.</p>

<p>2. Pray for wisdom for pastors and administrators as they seek to comfort and encourage and lead in the midst of chaos.</p>

<p>3. Pray for our children that are out of school, and especially for those who relied on the meals that they received at school. Pray that God would raise up caring Christians to find ways to feed them during this time of crisis.</p>

<p>4. Pray that God‚Äôs love would so fill us, so move us, so break our hearts afresh, that we could not contain it, but would share it with those who have no hope.</p>

<p>5. Pray that we will understand and actively share the message of ‚ÄúRighteousness by Faith‚Äù and that we will rest in the righteousness of Jesus.</p>

  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 13 - April 8</p>
<p>üìú OUR EYES ARE UPON YOU!</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúO our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.‚Äù(2 Chron. 20:12)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúGod would not have us remain pressed down by dumb sorrow, with sore and breaking hearts. He would have us look up and behold His dear face of love. The blessed Saviour stands by many whose eyes are so blinded by tears that they do not discern Him. He longs to clasp our hands, to have us look to Him in simple faith, permitting Him to guide us. His heart is open to our griefs, our sorrows, and our trials. He has loved us with an everlasting love and with loving-kindness compassed us about‚Ä¶Think of this, children of suffering and sorrow, and rejoice in hope. ‚ÄòThis is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.‚Äô (1 John 5:4).‚Äù Thoughts from the Mount of Blessings, p. 12</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What does it mean to keep our eyes on Jesus? What happens sometimes when our eyes are blinded by tears? What is God longing to do? Just as God‚Äôs heart is open to our sorrows and grief, so our heart should be open to the sorrow and grief of others. How can we extend His arm of compassion and tender sympathy to those around us today?</p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for those that are broken, for those that have recently lost loved ones, and for those struggling to feel that God is still near. </p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members facing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic across the country of Canada. Pray for strength and peace, and healing. Pray for spiritual revival and that the gospel will advance throughout Canada as a result of these challenging times. </p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for selfless love and giving to be the life of church members worldwide. Pray that those who have more resources would reach out and share with those who have less.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that church members worldwide would put away their differences and come close in Christian fellowship, pleading for the Latter Rain.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that church members worldwide would take personal responsibility for sharing the gospel with those around them even in the wake of large evangelistic events being canceled.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 12 - April 7</p>
<p>üìú Topic: GOD'S COVENANT WITH US</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúIf My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.‚Äù(2 Chron. 7:14)</p>

<p>üîñRead: ‚ÄúThe members of our churches need to be converted, to become more spiritual-minded. A chain of earnest, praying believers should encircle the world. Let all pray in humility. A few neighbors may meet together to pray for the Holy Spirit. Let those who cannot leave home, gather in their children, and unite in learning to pray together. They may claim the promise of the Saviour: ‚ÄòWhere two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.‚Äô ‚Äù Review and Herald, January 3, 1907, par. 4</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Based on 2 Chronicles 7:14 we see that God is looking for a heart of humility and repentance. Why is a spirit of humility so important when we pray? Why is united prayer important? How can we experience united prayer even while apart? </p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus (Day 12)</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that we would know as a church what it means to walk in humility before God and before each other. Pray that He would teach us how to pray, how to repent, and that healing would come as we seek God with all our hearts.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that God would help us as a people know what it means to be more spiritually minded, and how to create a chain of prayer around the world.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members living in the South England Conference in London. Pray that rather than this pandemic discouraging church members, there would be church growth, increased commitment to God and service.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for our youth across Europe, to come back to church, and for parents to be strong positive role models by bringing their children to church. </p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that every person, no matter their age, their gender, their official title or status, would recognize that they are to be witnesses and messengers of God‚Äôs love to a dying world.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 11 - April 6</p>
<p> üìú Topic: GOD'S RAINBOW OF ASSURANCE</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.‚Äù(Matt. 7:7-8)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúThe rainbow round about the throne is an assurance that God is true, that in Him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. We have sinned against Him, and are undeserving of His favor; yet He Himself has put into our lips that most wonderful of pleas, ‚ÄòDo not abhor us, for Thy name‚Äôs sake; do not disgrace the throne of Thy glory; remember, break not Thy covenant with us.‚Äô Jeremiah 14:21. When we come to Him confessing our unworthiness and sin, He has pledged Himself to give heed to our cry. The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His Word unto us.‚Äù Christ Object Lessons, p. 148 </p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Reflect on the three different types of prayer as seen in Matthew 7:7-8. What is the significance of the rainbow around God‚Äôs throne? What is God‚Äôs pledge to us? What is staked against the honor of His throne? How does this give you confidence today?</p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the ongoing health crisis throughout the United States and Europe. Pray that medical professionals can get the adequate supplies that are needed.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for health professionals, security workers, and essential government service personnel across the United States and around the world who have contracted COVID-19 while in the line of duty and service to others. Pray for healing for them.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for those living alone during this health pandemic, those struggling with fear, and those feeling the pain of isolation. Pray that they would discover they are not alone but that Jesus is right by their side.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for all churches in your local region that may have been closed because of the virus. Pray that congregations will find ways to stay ‚Äútogether‚Äù through internet live-streaming and witnessing in appropriate ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù ways, and that many more will be drawn to the truth because of this time of crisis.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for that God would re-ignite fresh passion in the hearts of His people‚Äîfresh passion for His Word, for prayer, and for mission!</p>

<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 10 - April 5</p>
<p>üìú Topic: HIDDEN IN HIS TABERNACLE</p>

<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúFor in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.‚Äù_ (Psalms 27:5)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúGod will do great things for those who trust in Him. The reason why His professed people have no greater strength is that they trust so much to their own wisdom, and do not give the Lord an opportunity to reveal His power in their behalf. He will help His believing children in every emergency if they will place their entire confidence in Him and faithfully obey Him.‚Äù _Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 493_</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What does it mean to be hidden in the secret of His tabernacle? Why do we as Christians have so little spiritual strength? What are two actions that God is waiting to see in us? How can we practice these two actions right now during our present crisis?</p>


<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members in the country of Fiji who are seeking to be a light even in the midst of a world in chaos. Pray that they would be pillars of hope and anchors of stability in these difficult times, reflecting the love of Jesus with all they meet.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the local Hope station in Fiji to become a trusted media platform throughout the island and that God will use it to reach many for God‚Äôs kingdom.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the Student Missionaries around the world who are weathering the COVID-19 pandemic away from home and loved ones. Pray for courage and strength for our missionaries.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for continued provision for those who are losing jobs, getting laid off, or wondering how to pay rent and utilities, and buy food when they can‚Äôt go to work.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other European countries who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus. Pray for comfort and strength to pick up and carry on.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Seven</p>
  <p>What type of faith do we need to have? And how are our greatest victories gained? Share with a loved one some 
  victories you have gained recently, or some victories that you need to gain. Pray for one another personally! </p>

  <p>‚ÄúCall upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you and you shall glorify Me.‚Äù Ps. 50:15</p>

<p>‚ÄúJacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His experience testifies to the power of 
importunate prayer. It is now that we are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of unyielding faith. 
The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual Christian are not those that are gained by 
talent or education, by wealth or the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience 
chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power.‚Äù 
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 203</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Six</p>
  <p>We are all in a very serious battle. Doctors and nurses and medical professionals on the front line are especially 
  feeling the heat of this battle. How can we encourage them in their work? How are we to fight our battles? And what 
  is the holy calling that the church must awake to in the spiritual realm? </p>

<p>‚ÄúAs for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD shall save me. Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry 
   aloud, and He shall hear my voice. He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there 
   were many against me.‚Äù Ps. 55:16-18 </p>
 
<p>‚ÄúWhen the church awakes to the sense of her holy calling, many more fervent and effective prayers will ascend to
   heaven for the Holy Spirit to point out the work and duty of God‚Äôs people regarding the salvation of souls. We 
  have a standing promise that God will draw near to every seeking soul.‚Äù 1 Selected Messages, p. 116 </p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Five</p>
  <p>We are told that the Holy Spirit will be given when we ask. We are also told that Heaven is waiting to give us 
this gift corporately as a church. So, what is heaven waiting for? Is heaven waiting for you and me? Could it be that
 we don't truly recognize our great spiritual need? Could it be that we've been content with a little of the Holy Spirit when 
God is longing to give us a full outpouring? </p>


<p>‚ÄúIf you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father 
give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!‚Äù Luke 11:13 </p>

<p>‚ÄúThe descent of the Holy Spirit upon the church is looked forward to as in the future; but it is the privilege of 
the church to have it now. Seek for it, pray for it, believe for it. We must have it, and Heaven is waiting to bestow it.‚Äù 
The Review and Herald, March 19, 1895</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Four</p>
  <p>What are some practical ways that we can combat fear? What about claiming Bible promises, singing songs, and 
reflecting on God's leading in our past? Share with someone a time when God carried you through a difficult trial and 
how your faith grew through that experience. As we reflect on His leading in the past, we will have renewed confidence 
for the future.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFaith grows strong by coming into conflict with doubts and opposing influences. The experience gained in these trials is of more value than the most costly jewels.‚Äù Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 555</p>

  <p>"He (Christ) was nailed to the cross. The crowd, in whose hearts humanity seemed 
to be dead, sought to aggravate the cruel sufferings of the Son of God by 
their revilings. But as a sheep before 
His shearers is dumb, so He opened not 
His mouth. He was giving His life for the life of the world, that all who 
believed in Him should not perish.... Amidst this outbreak take heart and be
 of good courage for we know who holds our lives in His

  <h1>Stewardship Week of Prayer</h1>
    <p>You are welcome to this revival week. Summary of stewardship revival week message, God First, with sis Grace Otieno Day One</p>
     <p> 1. Irrefutable principles of stewardship:</p>
      <p>i) Ownership- God;</p>
      <p>ii) Responsibility- given to man;</p>
      <p>iii) Accountability - expected of man</p>
      <p>iv) Reward- by God to man.</p>
      <p>2. Areas to put God First: time; temple (body); talent and treasure.</p>
      <p>3. Good management of time, temple, applying talent gives treasure out of which tithe is returned to God and in appreciation of abundance, offering is given.</p>
      <p>4. God is first, its man who fails to recognise and acknowledge this. As a result, he/ she fears and worries about:</p>
      <p>i) basic needs;</p>
      <p>ii) personal worth/ value;</p>
      <p>iii) things beyond his/her control.</p>
      <p>5. Purpose to put God First in all spheres of life, He is mightily able; He will provide the basic needs; He will lift up and give value, and take care of tomorrow.Put God First and taste how sweet God is.</p>
