  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 77 - June 11</p>
<p>üìú <strong>EMPOWERED TO SERVE</strong></p>
<p>üí° <strong>Study Verse:</strong> ‚ÄúBut you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.‚Äù ‚Äì Acts 1:8</p>

<p>üîñ <strong>Read:</strong> ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs servants do not all possess the same gifts, but they are all His workmen. Each is to learn of the Great Teacher, and then to communicate what he has learned. All do not do the same work, but under the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit they are all God‚Äôs instrumentalities. God employs a diversity of gifts in His work of winning souls from Satan‚Äôs army.‚Äù ‚Äì Ye Shall Receive Power, p. 192</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>It is an exciting thing to participate in God‚Äôs work of drawing people to Jesus. You, with your talents, abilities and influence can be an agent of grace in this world! That‚Äôs fantastic! When your life is surrendered to God, and you are filled with the Spirit, He will empower you to do your part in the wonderful privilege of soul-winning! He will sanctify your skills and give you His spiritual gifts to accomplish whatever task He sets before you.</p>

<p>Will you today devote your life to the work of winning souls with Jesus? Will you trust that the Holy Spirit will empower you to do even seemingly impossible tasks? Will you ask Jesus to baptize you with the Spirit as you engage in reaching out to the world around you?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Mary F.:</strong> Our Church has been blessed in being united in prayer during 100 Days of Prayer. The Church feels the peace of God, and the church sees the mighty hands of God.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Ronald L.:</strong> During lockdown a small group consisting mostly of former Adventists and newly interested individuals were actively engaged in Bible study. As their district pastor, I met with that small group, leading in a revival worship service. At the end of the meeting we arranged for a foot washing and communion service and to our amazement a total of 52 members participated in the service of which, 60% of the participants were former and new members who accepted Jesus and made their bold covenant through communion service. I would like to Praise God for including Papua New Guinea in the 100 Days of Prayer on Day 57. God answered your prayers the next day May 23 by leading His lost sheep back to His fold. Praise God!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for churches in the Caribbean islands who on top of dealing with the pandemic now have to prepare for the 2020 hurricane season.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for the ministry of the Ellicott City Adventist Church, MD, USA, as they collect masks, gloves and goggles for medical personnel.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 76 - June 10 </p>
<p>üìú <strong>Topic: THE BEST GIFT! </strong></p>
<p>üí° <strong>Study Verse:</strong> _‚ÄúIf you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!‚Äù <strong>(Luke 11:13)</strong><p>

<p>üîñ <strong>Read:</strong> ‚ÄúThe Lord is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who serve Him than parents are to give good gifts to their children. For the daily baptism of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition to God.‚Äù ‚Äì <strong>[Acts of the Apostles, p. 50]</strong><p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong><p>
<p>The Father is very much willing to give you the Holy Spirit if you ask Him. God never forces Himself upon you; that is why you need to ask. The original Greek in Luke 11 indicates, that this asking is an ongoing, lifelong activity of seeking more of Him, of opening up your heart to God like a flower opens to the sun. Daily and continually we need to be immersed and filled with the Presence of God through His Spirit. God‚Äôs work of sanctification and character-preparation for eternity is a process. Every day He gives us new convictions, challenges and directions through His Word, and we need to daily invite His Spirit into our hearts for grace and ability to obey and to do His good will, loving others as He loves us.<p>

<p>You might have asked for the Holy Spirit before, but understanding that you need His baptism on a daily basis, will you ask for more of His presence in your life? Will you invite the Holy Spirit into every compartment of your heart without holding anything back?<p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong><p>
<p><strong>Luis U.:</strong> Me and my wife have been using Skype to study the Bible with six people during this quarantine. I invited many people to watch the special programs broadcasted by our Adventist channel in Brazil and many people who are not even Christians are now very open to the message of Our Lord! Some of my non-Christian friends have started to believe in the Second Coming of Christ!<p>

<p><strong>Winfrida M.:</strong> I want to share with you a word of encouragement that prayers are working! Last Sabbath five people were baptized in Kinshasa following the 100 Days of Prayer program which was shared through Radio, WhatsApp and other social media!<p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong><p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong>for members who are backsliding during this pandemic. Pray for the Holy Spirit to speak clearly into their hearts. Pray for those who can reach out to them to have courage, wisdom and love as they seek to help them come back to a faithful walk with Jesus.<p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for members in the West Zimbabwe Conference who are rallying to support the needy, vulnerable, elderly, and disabled in their communities.<p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for members and/or former members and youth who are trapped in false teachings and heresy. Pray for God to open their eyes and for the church to help them find the truth as it is in Jesus.<p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for God‚Äôs protection over medical professionals at CHI Memorial Hospital Chattanooga, and other hospitals worldwide. </p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 75 - June 9 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.‚Äù ‚Äì Galatians 5:22-23</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs you receive the Spirit of Christ‚Äîthe Spirit of unselfish love and labor for others‚Äîyou will grow and bring forth fruit. The graces of the Spirit will ripen in your character. Your faith will increase, your convictions deepen, your love be made perfect. More and more you will reflect the likeness of Christ in all that is pure, noble, and lovely. . . . This fruit can never perish, but will produce after its kind a harvest unto eternal life.‚Äù ‚Äì Christ‚Äôs Object Lessons, p. 67-68</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>The Spirit leads us to Jesus. And as we abide in Jesus through a daily connection with the Holy Spirit, He will develop in us a character that reflects each day a little more the selfless, self-sacrificial, loving character of Christ. It is a transformational process of a lifetime. Just like a mango does not appear an hour after the seed has been planted but takes its time to grow into a tree that eventually bears fruit, so also the work of sanctification is a process that takes time. But rest assured that through surrender and faithfulness every aspect of the fruit of the Spirit will become evident in your life!</p>

<p>Have you let the Holy Spirit develop in you His fruit? Are there some aspects of the fruit of the Spirit which you have been resisting Him to work on? Is it your desire to reflect Jesus more and more until all that people see is Jesus‚Äô character of love in you?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Jones S.: I thank God for the 100 Days of Prayer. It has brought light into my life. I have started an Adventist bakery during this period and I'm spreading the Word of God through the bakery. Through the work of the Holy Spirit one of the people getting the messages has decided to become a Seventh-day Adventist. I thank God for showing me the many ways we can spread His word and hasten His coming!</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Brother P.: During the lockdown, I went through phases of questioning and each week, God allowed me to receive the answer to my questions through the different messages and experiences shared by the authors of the 100 Days of Prayer. Thank you, Lord, for your great love and for the moments of sharing that you allow us to have with the whole world.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for pastors, elders and lay preachers around the world who are engaging in various online evangelistic efforts.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Adventist church in Iceland. There are very few members and Iceland is a very secular country. Pray for a breakthrough, revival, and a mighty harvest for Jesus.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for an Adventist drug and alcohol rehab center in Guatemala‚Äôs capital city. In addition to finding freedom from addiction, more than 1,500 people have been baptized in nine years of ministry. Please ask God to continue to bless, provide, and change lives for eternity.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for an Adventist vegan restaurant in Byron Bay, Australia. It has been ranked number 1 in a popular Australian tourist spot. Please pray that God will bless this ministry and that He will work through it to reach hearts.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 74 - June 8 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.‚Äù ‚Äì John 16:8-11</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end. From the Day of Pentecost to the present time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To all who have accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a counselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness.‚Äù ‚Äì Acts of the Apostles, p. 49</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Part of the Holy Spirit‚Äôs work is to convict of sin, righteousness, and judgment. These three elements of His work of conviction are represented in the Sanctuary and its services. In the courtyard is where the sacrifice for sin took place (pointing to Jesus on the Cross); in the Holy Place the three elements of experiencing the imparted righteousness of Christ were revealed in the Table of Showbread (Bible study), the Altar of Incense (Prayer), and the Candlestick (Spirit-filled witnessing). All of which were exemplified in the life of Christ as a model for us today; and in the Most Holy Place we are reminded of the importance and reality of the judgment as the High Priest only entered it on the Day of Atonement (Jesus engaging in the investigative judgment on your behalf).</p>

<p>In other words: The Holy Spirit‚Äôs work is to lead you into a salvific experience through faith in everything that Jesus has done and is doing for you.</p>

<p>Can you see the important and beautiful work of the Holy Spirit? Will you joyfully embrace His work of conviction and let Him not only lead you to Jesus, but make you like Him in character in preparation for the Judgment?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ More and more churches have been able to upgrade their digital platforms to reach out and engage with the community online.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ John K.: It is amazing that during this terrible time, church members in our region have become more faithful in returning tithe and offerings. We met our tithe goal in May! We are praying morning and evening during the 100 Days of Prayer. It has not only planted but deepened the prayer culture in my home. Last night my 2 year old daughter called me at dawn and said "Daddy, it is time to pray!" I praise God and realize that He has planted what has been missing in my family ‚Äì a culture of prayer.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for many, young and old, who are struggling with media addictions.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for members in Perth, Australia who are evangelizing through letterboxing in the local community.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for baby Tyson, in New Zealand who is on life support. The doctors want to remove the life support, but we believe God is working as he has opened his eyes, making noises and moving his feet.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Adventist Life Hope Center in downtown Nazareth. It offers English, computer, and health classes. Ask God to bless and grow this ministry, to protect and guide workers and reach hearts.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 73 - June 7 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.‚Äù ‚Äì John 16:13-14</p>

<p>‚ÄúThrough the Scriptures the Holy Spirit speaks to the mind, and impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He exposes error, and expels it from the soul. It is by the Spirit of truth, working through the Word of God, that Christ subdues His chosen people to Himself.‚Äù
‚Äì The Desire of Ages, p. 671</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Jesus is the Truth. He is the Personification of Truth. As the Creator He defined and established all reality in perfect harmony with His character of selfless love. Satan introduced falsehood and lies into the world, trying to establish a new reality of selfishness, which is really just a grand illusion leading to death. In order to escape the illusions of Satan we have been given the Word of God. The Holy Spirit is the One Who can open our eyes to all truths of the Bible as they are in Jesus. He is the One Who can lead us out of the illusions and into the light of Christ, Who is the Truth, the Word made flesh.</p>

<p>Will you let the Holy Spirit glorify Jesus in your life by leading you into the truth through His Word? Will you not only let Him reveal truth to you, but also let Him reform your heart into harmony with God‚Äôs reality of selfless love?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Vasantha P.: Because of this crisis I got much time for reading the Scriptures and taking notes, watching sermons, listening to spiritual songs. This has led to the happiest moments I have ever had!</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Carol D.: I am thanking God for his mercy and goodness. I have been a Seventh-day Adventist for 33 years, and this pandemic is a blessing for me, because I did not recognize the importance of health reform. God has been working on my heart. I have chosen to become a vegetarian. To God be the glory!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for churches that are struggling to go digital with their services due to a lack of technological equipment and internet services.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Adventist believers in Oman who are trying to obtain a space to gather for worship after the pandemic.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for families that are struggling with demonic oppression. Pray for victory over sins that might be the entrance for Satan to come and destroy.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for an Adventist house for homeless women in Leipzig, Germany. Over 25 years this ministry has served and supported around 2,000 women. Please ask God to continue to provide for this ministry, bringing hope and healing to those who need it most.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 72 - June 6 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúNevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.‚Äù ‚Äì John 16:7</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. . . . Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, . . . It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world‚Äôs Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His church. Of the Spirit Jesus said, ‚ÄòHe shall glorify Me.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì The Desire of Ages, p. 671</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever fully appreciated the incredible gift of the Holy Spirit? He is part of the Heavenly Trio, the Godhead, and He was sent to you as a gift from Jesus. He speaks, leads, convicts, helps, comforts, transforms and empowers you on your transformational journey of becoming more like our loving Jesus.</p>

<p>Are you comfortable in inviting the Holy Spirit into your life? Have you experienced Him ‚Äúmaking effectual what has been wrought out by the world‚Äôs Redeemer‚Äù?</p>

<p>Why not accept the gift of the Holy Spirit from Jesus and invite Him into your heart, giving Him access to every aspect of your life?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢Nicole P.: I‚Äôve seen my kids grow in their friendships with each other as they have played and worked together without friends. We‚Äôve had more time for both morning and evening family worships without anyone missing because of work or school. We‚Äôve gotten lots of things done in our home, all working together. And we‚Äôve had lots of great family conversations about end-time events.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Gabriel A.: I thank God for a special healing during these 100 Days of Prayer. Our Sabbath School song leader reported a strange illness in his leg. After prayers God healed him and he ministered the following Sabbath, May 23. Praise God!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢Pray for members in Nigeria who are affected by persecution and harassment from various bandits and even local officials.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray for plans to build a lifestyle center in Puncak, West Java. A financial miracle is needed!</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray for Martina R. who has been fighting an auto-immune disease for two years. Her sickness has made it impossible for her to be engaged much in God‚Äôs work.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray for the ‚ÄòOrigins‚Äô center in the Galapagos Islands. They are reaching tourists from cities around the world. Origins is the church‚Äôs first high-tech museum. Ask God to put His hand over it, to bring visitors, and to give staff the words He wants them to speak to guests.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 71 - June 5 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>When a Storm Catches You by Surprise!
<br>By Paul Dysinger</p>

<p>I was just putting our baby son Ethan down for a nap. It was a beautiful sunny day. Some clouds had just rolled over in the cool of the evening.</p>

<p>And then it hit. And it hit fast and hard.</p>

<p>Ethan had just fallen asleep when I heard my wife Natasha calling from the living room. I came out of the bedroom and looked out the window. And the first thing I noticed was the wind. It was blowing incredibly hard! And the sky was getting darker and darker.</p>

<p>Then we heard the tree limbs. Crash. Crack. Snap. They were literally breaking off of trees and slamming into the side of our house from the woods nearby. I looked out the other side of our cabin to see our greenhouse completely de-skinned. The entire plastic top had completely torn off. I grabbed my phone to check the weather, but the Internet was out.</p>

<p>"Honey, should we go?" I hear Natasha saying. "Yes - let's go," I responded.</p>

<p>We grabbed sleeping Ethan from off the bed and I threw my laptop into my backpack, then we darted for the car - spooked that at any moment a flying limb or falling tree could intercept our flight. We prayed as we flew along the dirt road up to my parent‚Äôs house where the basement would be a much safer place to wait out the storm. Already a tree had fallen across our driveway that we had to circumvent. Thankfully we could.</p>

<p>By now it was pouring rain. And so, through the blinding rain and raging wind we finally made it to the basement of my parents - and to safety. And here is the crazy thing. None of us saw it coming. No one. My uncle had been out on the tractor and had to ditch it and run inside. He also had a greenhouse that was de-skinned like ours and another one that faired a lot worse (looked like an elephant stepped on it). The storm hit us unexpectedly and we weren‚Äôt prepared.</p>

<p>Thankfully we are all safe and everyone is ok. But it still hit us unprepared. Kind of like how this whole COVID-19 pandemic hit our world unprepared. And here's the thing, we know there are more storms coming according to Bible prophecy. The question is, ‚ÄúHow are we preparing to weather those storms?‚Äù</p>

<p>Frankly, as a gardener you realize that you aren't in control of nature. The wind, the rain, the sun, the snow‚Äîyou simply can't control it. You can plan ahead and prepare for it if you have a good weather forecast. But sometimes things happen that we couldn't foresee. Then what?</p>

<p>I'll tell you what we do. We pray. We recognize that God is in control even when crazy things happen. And then we get up and keep going. When life comes crashing down around us, we‚Äôve got to get up and rebuild. The storms of life may knock us down - but we've got to reach out to the strength of God and move forward.</p>

<p>For us, our greenhouse was a small loss. Sure, it cost us a bit of cash and some time to fix. But within a few days we had the plastic back on - and this time we hope that we are more prepared, should such a situation occur again.</p>

<p>But what about the storms of life? What about the physical, emotional, spiritual, and economic storms created by COVID-19? How are you responding? How will you rebuild? What lessons are you learning that will prepare you for future storms? When things happen that are outside of your control, where do you turn for strength and comfort?</p>

<p>Jesus is our anchor and hope. We can turn to Him our Prince of Peace Who can calm storms with a word from His lips. We can turn to Him to bring us through the storms of life and even through the end times. Will you trust in Him today?</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.<br>Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is an everlasting rock.‚Äù ‚Äì Isaiah 26:3-4</p>

<p>Paul Dysinger and his wife Natasha live in Tennessee where they run a business in gardening and teaching people how to farm. (borntogrow.net)</p>

<p>Calling Upon Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you. Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is an everlasting rock.‚Äù<br>‚Äì Isaiah 26:3-4</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>How have you reacted to the worldwide pandemic? How has this affected or not affected your faith in Jesus? Are you willing to trust in Him for the next unexpected storm in your life? Do you believe that Jesus can truly be your Everlasting Rock?</p>

<p><strong>ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE:</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to show you any areas of your life where you might have not given Him full access to. Anything you might be unwilling to give up control over. Ask Him to forgive you and to help you trust in Him. Maybe this pandemic crisis has revealed to you some things in your life where you have been lacking to exercise faith. Pray to our loving Jesus to help you to surrender all to Him and to learn to trust in Him despite the storms of life.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚òëÔ∏è Alex G.: Two great blessings! I had started a Bible study with a physician from my town. And because of COVID-19 we could study way more often than before. She accepted to be baptized even before visiting the church! I also was very blessed personally for, even though I had to cancel all my trips for the year, I could organize myself much better, so I could pray more, read my Bible more, write more and work more efficiently. In the midst of many sorrows came great blessings too!</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 70 - June 4 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:17-18</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe divine beauty of the character of Christ, of whom the noblest and most gentle among men are but a faint reflection; . . . Jesus, the express image of the Father‚Äôs person, the effulgence of His glory; the self-denying Redeemer, throughout His pilgrimage of love on earth, was a living representation of the character of the law of God. In His life it is made manifest that heaven-born love, Christlike principles, underlie the laws of eternal rectitude.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 49</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>The law of God is the law of love. Jesus revealed what keeping the law truly looks like. You can keep the law only by completely relying on the Holy Spirit for help. As you believe that He is going to help you to live a life of selfless love and as you by faith do actions of love, His divine power will enable you and work in you to will and do of His good pleasure.</p>

<p>If you are struggling with faithfulness to God‚Äôs law, will you ask Jesus today to forgive you, and fill you with His Holy Spirit? Will you ask Him to help you not just to keep the letter of the law, but the spirit of the law, which is selfless, sacrificial love to God and all people?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Marietta A.: ‚ÄúThank you for your prayers! My son has recovered from Covid-19 and is back to normal and healthy. Praise God!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ The mortality rate of the Covid-19 pandemic in Spain has decreased significantly from 11% to now just 2%.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the urban center of influence in Guatemala City which offers food, toothbrushes, showers, and a place to wash clothes for those who are living on the streets. Please ask God to meet the deepest needs of the visitors to this center, and to help them find hope for eternity.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the media, committed to providing up-to-date information concerning Covid-19. Pray that God will help them to communicate with appropriate seriousness.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who are struggling with anxiety, depression, and fear during this time of crisis. Pray that they will find help, courage, hope, and healing in Jesus.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for pastors, teachers, missionaries, and members in Laos. In some regions it is very hard to use technology to reach people to minister to during this pandemic and in-person visits are at times necessary to help individuals struggling with various issues.</p>

<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:14-16</p>

<p>‚ÄúHumanity has in itself no light. Apart from Christ we are like an unkindled taper, . . . But when we turn toward the Sun of Righteousness, when we come in touch with Christ, the whole soul is aglow with the brightness of the divine presence. Christ‚Äôs followers are to be more than a light in the midst of men. They are the light of the world . . . Angels of glory wait to communicate through you heaven‚Äôs light and power to souls that are ready to perish.‚Äù<br>‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 40</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Did you read the quote above? Do you realize that angels are waiting to work through you to reach lost people? Isn‚Äôt this amazing?</p>

<p>You are invited to not only be filled with the Holy Spirit for your personal sanctification, but to actively participate in shining the truth, love, and righteousness of Jesus to a world whose time is running out.</p>

<p>Think about your family, your friends, your neighbors, your co-workers. Ask God to show you who needs the light of Jesus in their life? Who should you pray for and contact this week?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Many countries around the world are beginning to carefully lift their lockdowns.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ The World Health Organization is saying: ‚ÄúIf this virus is teaching us anything, it‚Äôs humility.‚Äù People are recognizing how frail they are. This is a great opportunity for the church to show seekers the hope we have in Jesus!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God‚Äôs blessing on members who are operating taxis in Panama City, using them as mobile centers of influence. Half of Panama‚Äôs citizens live in Panama City.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the urban center of influence in Battambang, Cambodia. It includes a gym, a vegetarian restaurant, a playground, a chapel, health education, music education, and a language school. Pray for God‚Äôs blessing on this multi-faceted approach, and ask Him to grow the ministry and bring the people whose hearts He has been preparing.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the upcoming Adventist Women Ministries small group evangelism in the Western Nigeria Union.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 67 - June 1 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:11-12</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn every age God‚Äôs chosen messengers have been reviled and persecuted, yet through their affliction the knowledge of God has been spread abroad. Every disciple of Christ is to step into the ranks and carry forward the same work, knowing that its foes can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. God means that truth shall be brought to the front and become the subject of examination and discussion, even through the contempt placed upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated; every controversy, every reproach, every effort to restrict liberty of conscience, is God‚Äôs means of awakening minds that otherwise might slumber.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 33</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When persecution comes, when your reputation is being slandered, when your life could be in danger, then Jesus‚Äô love and truth will shine the brightest. How you react, what you say, what you do when faced with these pressures, will greatly determine the impact your faithfulness can have on those who seek to ruin your life.</p>

<p>Why not ask Jesus to help you to be faithful and loving today and everyday so that you are able to show that same love even under persecution?</p>

<p>Will you pray to Him even now and ask Him to make you a true Christian who will stand for Jesus though the heaven‚Äôs fall?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pastors, church workers, teachers, and evangelistic initiatives around the world are struggling financially due to the decrease in tithes and offerings. But they are putting their trust in the God of miracles. God is opening many doors for even greater ministry to people with less resources than before.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Warwick Seventh-day Adventist Church‚Äôs mobile soup kitchen in Sydney, Australia, which serves up soup and is connecting with lonely people in their area. Please ask God to help them build connections in the community.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the new medical school for East Africa in Kigali, Rwanda. Pray for the students who graduate from it, and the people they serve.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the rebuilding of the South Philippine Adventist College church which was destroyed in an earthquake in December 2019.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a center of influence in the midst of a Muslim community in an unnamed city. Some of the Muslims have requested prayer for them during this Covid-19 crisis. They believe that Adventist‚Äôs prayers are heard by God.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 66 - May 31 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:10</p>

<p>‚ÄúJesus does not present to His followers the hope of attaining earthly glory and riches, and of having a life free from trial, but He presents to them the privilege of walking with their Master in the paths of self-denial and reproach, because the world knows them not.‚Äù
‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 29</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When selfless-love, righteousness, holiness, and truth is being revealed by faithful Christians, Satan will arouse resistance and hatred amongst those who choose to ignore the Holy Spirit‚Äôs voice. We can have the assurance that in all persecution we might face, Jesus will be with us and will be glorifying Himself through our challenging experience.</p>

<p>Have you experienced persecution because of your faithfulness to Jesus? Why, or why not?</p>

<p>Will you choose today to cast off any desire to please the world, and prayerfully focus on revealing God‚Äôs glory, even if that might result in persecution?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Many churches are becoming creative in conducting their Sabbath services while physical distancing.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ The pandemic has brought the importance of our health message to the forefront of members around the world. The interest in preventative health work, NEWSTART, etc. is growing. Now is a wonderful time to lead people to a comprehensive understanding of God‚Äôs laws of health and wholeness.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the ministry of Norway‚Äôs oldest Adventist church, now adding a center of influence to provide free Norwegian classes for migrants, a cooking school, a conversation caf√©, and more.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the ministry of two new mobile health vans in Chiapas, Mexico. Pray for the patients they transport and the weekend medical brigades they support, making possible free medical checkups, minor surgeries, dental procedures, ultrasounds checks, eye exams and more.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a revival of true godliness and a renewed interest in evangelism in each member and church around the world.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the church in Burundi. It is going through various struggles and issues at this time. Only God‚Äôs intervention can bring peace.</p>

<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:9</p>

<p>‚ÄúChrist is ‚Äòthe Prince of Peace‚Äô (Isaiah 9:6), and it is His mission to restore to earth and heaven the peace that sin has broken. ‚ÄòBeing justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.‚Äô Romans 5:1. Whoever consents to renounce sin and open his heart to the love of Christ, becomes a partaker of this heavenly peace.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 27</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Salvation in Jesus gives us perfect peace. But Jesus is not calling us to only experience peace with God through a surrender of your life to Him. No, He also calls you to become an agent of peace ‚Äì a peacemaker. In this time of crisis, will you choose to be such an agent of peace? Will you do all you can to shine the peace of God ‚Äì His presence of love ‚Äì into the lives of those around you who live in anxiety and fear?</p>

<p>If you have been the cause of strife and disputes in your family or church, will you seek forgiveness and spread God‚Äôs peace?</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 64 - May 29 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚Äú. . . however trifling this or that wrong act may seem in the eyes of men, no sin is small in the sight of God. Man‚Äôs judgment is partial, imperfect; but God estimates all things as they really are. The drunkard is despised and is told that his sin will exclude him from heaven; while pride, selfishness, and covetousness too often go unrebuked. But these are sins that are especially offensive to God; for they are contrary to the benevolence of His character, to that unselfish love which is the very atmosphere of the unfallen universe. He who falls into some of the grosser sins may feel a sense of his shame and poverty and his need of the grace of Christ; but pride feels no need, and so it closes the heart against Christ and the infinite blessings He came to give.‚Äù (Steps to Christ, p. 30)</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Marlynn W.: ‚ÄúWe praise the Lord that during the 100 Days of Prayer for the pandemic God has secured us with jobs, food, and shelter. The Lord has also convicted us to move out to the countryside. Additionally, He has given me an opportunity to witness to the Muslim community.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Moses M.: ‚ÄúThank you to for praying for us. The Lord has heard your prayers! It is amazing! During the national lockdown period in Namibia, about 1100 people have enrolled in studying Bible lessons, 70% of which are not Seventh-day Adventists.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for students around the world who are unable to work due to the lockdowns. Pray that God will provide them with the financial means to pay for tuition.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for victims of domestic violence around the world.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the family of Alexander Ostankin, a pastor who was murdered as he was ministering. Pray that God will turn the blood of this martyr into the seed of the gospel.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who are currently struggling with Covid-19. Pray for their full recovery.</p>

<p>Weekly devotional: <strong>The Beauty in Brokenness</strong>
_by Melody Mason_</p>

<p>I will never forget, a number of years ago, as I was preparing to lead a prayer service for a large event, how the Holy Spirit convicted me of something specific in my life that I needed to make right with God. Overwhelmed, I sank to my knees on the floor that night as I prayed, ‚ÄúOh Lord, please forgive me...‚Äù</p>

<p>However, while I confessed my sin to God, certain steps were necessary to make proper amends. But I couldn‚Äôt take these steps immediately, so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do. Should I still go forward with my prayer ministry responsibilities or should I get someone else to fill in for me until I had made things right?</p>

<p>As a respected leader in ministry, it was very humiliating to think of admitting to others that I had failed God in a specific area. I didn't want to make a stir and appear spiritually weak to my teammates, or to the many strangers that were in attendance at the meetings. So, with a heavy heart and tears in my eyes, I went to sleep that night, determined that I would just ask someone else to lead the prayer service the next day.</p>

<p>However, the next morning as I set out to find someone to take my place, God stopped me in my tracks as the Holy Spirit began speaking to my heart. "Melody, you need to lead the prayer service this morning. Don‚Äôt get someone to replace you!‚Äù
‚ÄúWait God‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt mean this?‚Äù I said as fresh tears came to my eyes. But the Holy Spirit continued to speak to my heart.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I want you to lead, however, you are not to lead it as the person you want everyone to think you are. Don‚Äôt you see? I‚Äôm not looking for people to lead who cover up their sins and go on as if everything is okay. I‚Äôm looking for yielded broken vessels; vessels that will humble themselves to such a degree that pride is gone. Only then can I really use them for My glory. I know this hurts, but you need to share with the congregation what I convicted you of last night. Be honest about how you‚Äôve failed Me! Then invite them to come with you to the cross to put away all sin and compromise. You see, if people wait to come until they have everything in order, they will never come.‚Äù</p>

<p>Again, I began to protest. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this, Lord! What will everyone think when they see how I‚Äôve failed You?‚Äù</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit spoke softly to my heart as He turned my eyes toward heaven. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter what they think. This is not about protecting your reputation. This is about bringing glory to God. But, if He is to work, you must humble yourself.‚Äù</p>

<p>Oh, how I did not want to obey the Holy Spirit‚Äôs promptings that morning. If I could have run away like Jonah, or crawled in a cave, I would have done so immediately. But I knew what I must do. I had to obey.</p>

<p>Shaking and with tears in my eyes, I went before hundreds of people that morning and shared what the Lord had laid on my heart. You could have heard a pin drop in the room as everyone listened. ‚ÄúJesus tells us to come as we are,‚Äù I said softly, as I continued to the wipe tears away from my eyes. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm coming as I am and I‚Äôm inviting you to join me at the foot of the cross.‚Äù</p>

<p>At this invitation everyone got out of their chairs and came forward to the front of the room. There was soft weeping here and there as different people asked God‚Äôs forgiveness for those areas of sin and compromise that had crept into their lives. And the Holy Spirit was there. In the book Steps to Christ we are told:</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf you see your sinfulness, do not wait to make yourself better. How many there are who think they are not good enough to come to Christ. Do you expect to become better through your own efforts? ‚ÄòCan the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.‚Äô Jeremiah 13:23. There is help for us only in God. We must not wait for stronger persuasions, for better opportunities, or for holier tempers. We can do nothing of ourselves. We must come to Christ just as we are.‚Äù (Steps to Christ, p. 31)</p>

<p>In hindsight, I think this was one of the most sweet, sacred prayer services I‚Äôve ever experienced, for God did a deep work of cleansing among all of us that morning. Many hearts were broken, but how beautiful and healing the brokenness was. In Psalm 51:17 the Bible tells us, ‚ÄúThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, A broken and a contrite heart‚ÄîThese, O God, You will not despise.‚Äù</p>

<p>What offering are you seeking to bring to God these days? Is it your best works, your best prayers, your best attempts to be a strong witness even in the midst of life-shattering events? Our best offering has nothing to do with our works, but is the complete brokenness of self, of pride and all self-sufficiency as we come to the foot of the cross. As the famous hymn Rock of Ages says so beautifully, ‚ÄúNothing in my hand I bring, simply to thy cross I cling.‚Äù Let‚Äôs cling to that cross today!</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 63 - May 28 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:8</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Holy Spirit takes the truth concerning God and Him whom He hath sent, and opens it to the understanding and to the heart. The pure in heart see God in a new and endearing relation, as their Redeemer; and while they discern the purity and loveliness of His character, they long to reflect His image. They see Him as a Father longing to embrace a repenting son, and their hearts are filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory.‚Äù
‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, p. 26</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When we faithfully walk with God, He continually opens our eyes to more and more of an understanding of His character of love, His will, and His beauty. In the realization of His perfect holiness and purity our impurities come to light and we are invited to receive the cleansing only He can give. On this side of heaven, we see with the eye of faith, but one day soon, we shall see Him face to face! That will be a glorious day.</p>

<p>Until then, why not ask Him to cleanse our hearts from all impurity and filth? Why not actively search for an ever-clearer vision and understanding of our God and His will?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Shana S.: ‚ÄúDuring the 100 Days of Prayer I started praying for a friend of 20 years who, out of the blue, started to ignore me in 2017. Blocked me on her phone, etc. I had tried to reach out many times. No response. Our prayer leader encouraged us to cry out to God. I did. I called again. No response. The next day she called me back! She unblocked me and told me that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. We reconnected and reconciled. God answers our prayers!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ John K.: ‚ÄúHere in Uganda the lockdown has left many starving. During a 100 Days of Prayer session, God gave me wisdom to help the starving children. I sent a message to 100 families from church and asked them to share food with starving people near them. This simple idea spread across the entire region through a journalist who shared it online. With the new connections we made we now started WhatsApp based evangelistic meetings!‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a pure heart, free from sin, cleansed from all impurity.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for funeral directors, morticians, embalmers and funeral service staff as they are in direct contact with many who have died of Covid-19.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the church in Fiji, as they are considering structural changes and stronger empowerment of the laity in taking ownership of various responsibilities.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the ministry of the Harvest Seventh-day Adventist Church in Alabama, USA. They are located in a low income, high crime area, and have seen very little fruit in their soul-winning efforts. Pray for God to bring a breakthrough.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 62 - May 27 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:7</p>

<p>‚ÄúGod is Himself the source of all mercy. His name is ‚Äòmerciful and gracious.‚Äô Exodus 34:6. He does not treat us according to our desert. He does not ask if we are worthy of His love, but He pours upon us the riches of His love, to make us worthy. He is not vindictive. He seeks not to punish, but to redeem . . . He yearns with intense desire to relieve the woes of men and to apply His balsam to their wounds . . . The merciful are ‚Äòpartakers of the divine nature,‚Äô and in them the compassionate love of God finds expression. All whose hearts are in sympathy with the heart of Infinite Love will seek to reclaim and not to condemn. Christ dwelling in the soul is a spring that never runs dry. Where He abides, there will be an overflowing of beneficence.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, p. 22</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Take a moment and think about God‚Äôs mercy upon your life. He only looks out for your best, despite your unfaithfulness. He is not requiring you to prove your worth to Him in order to receive His gift of salvation. He treats you with love.</p>

<p>When you experience and internalize God‚Äôs mercy, the Holy Spirit will enable you to become an agent of mercy; treating those around you with the same kind of love and mercy. Especially those who have wronged you.</p>

<p>Will you choose today, with the help of Jesus, to extend God‚Äôs mercy to people in your life? Forgiving them before they ask for it, loving them before being given a reason to? Desiring their best no matter if they are worth it or not?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Elham L.: ‚ÄúI have been asking God for a deeper relationship with him. Since incorporating the 100 Days of Prayers on a daily basis into my daily devotions using a prayer journal my prayer life has been revitalized. It‚Äôs mind-blowing!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Sherma J.: ‚ÄúGod answered a prayer for a missing member. She ignored my attempts to call her. When I visited, she would just talk about her problems and not let me say anything. I prayed for God to work on her heart and instead of me trying to call her that she would call me. Two weeks later she called and said that her problems are gone and she wants to come back to church and recommit her life to God!‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God to make you an agent of mercy to the people in your life.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for students who are struggling to come up with school fees in order to receive an education. Pray that they will experience God‚Äôs leading in their education.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the people and members in Zimbabwe. The majority of them can not afford to stay on lockdown. The health care system is unable to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for various pastors in Indonesia who have contracted Covid-19.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God to bless the outreach of students in Brazil who are volunteering to produce hand sanitizer for the elderly.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 61 - May 26 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.‚Äù
‚Äì Matthew 5:6</p>

<p>‚ÄúRighteousness is holiness, likeness to God, and ‚ÄòGod is love.‚Äô 1 John 4:16. It is conformity to the law of God, for ‚Äòall Thy commandments are righteousness‚Äô (Psalm 119:172), and ‚Äòlove is the fulfilling of the law‚Äô (Romans 13:10). Righteousness is love, and love is the light and the life of God. The righteousness of God is embodied in Christ. We receive righteousness by receiving Him.‚Äù‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, p. 18</p>

<p>HEART QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>Do you hunger and thirst for Christ‚Äôs righteousness?</p>

<p>His life of perfect selfless love and His substitutional death provides you with a twofold gift of justifying grace: 1.) His imputed righteousness, which is the promise that you are covered by His perfect life through faith in that promise. 2.) His imparted righteousness, which is the promise that He will transform you from a being of selfishness, into a being that reflects the selfless love of Jesus, through living faith in that promise.</p>

<p>This twofold gift will fulfill you; it will truly satisfy you; it will save you! Why not accept it today and start living a happy and Jesus-filled life in the awareness of this amazing reality of God‚Äôs redemptive love?</p>

<p>PRAISE REPORTS:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Jane D.: ‚ÄùGod healed the sick who I prayed for. He also amazingly touched the hearts of my family.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Marcia N.: ‚ÄúMy daughter has been addicted to drugs for many years, was homeless and even went to jail. Our prayer group started praying for her and as a result she is now in a facility getting help, her health is improving, she has a renewed interest in God, and she is reading Spirit of Prophecy books. She said that it is God who helped her. I praise God for His love for us and helping us through these heartbreaking years. Weeping endures for a night, but JOY comes in the morning!‚Äù</p>

<p>PRAYER REQUESTS:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Christ‚Äôs righteousness to cover and fill you.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God to intervene in the outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis in the upper west region of Ghana. This outbreak has already killed many people in that region.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for churches that have become inactive since the Covid-19 outbreak. Pray for pastors, church leaders, and members to know how to best connect at this time. Pray for a new focus on the importance of prayer.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for members in Myanmar as they utilize the internet to spread the gospel in this time of crisis.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 60 - May 25 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:5</p>

<p>‚ÄúHuman nature is ever struggling for expression, ready for contest; but he who learns of Christ is emptied of self, of pride, of love of supremacy, and there is silence in the soul. Self is yielded to the disposal of the Holy Spirit. Then we are not anxious to have the highest place. We have no ambition to crowd and elbow ourselves into notice; but we feel that our highest place is at the feet of our Saviour. We look to Jesus, waiting for His hand to lead, listening for His voice to guide.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, p. 15</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>There is no happier place in life than knowing that you are in harmony with God in all you do. This harmony exists when Jesus is sought after, and the exaltation of self is abandoned, recognizing that the sinful ‚Äúheart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick.‚Äù (Jeremiah 17:9). Humility, meekness, is the key to letting the Holy Spirit develop in you a truly beautiful, Christ-like character.</p>
<p>Will you ask Jesus to take away your prideful desires, your self-centered ambitions, and your love of supremacy? Will you ask Him to replace them by enabling you to practice gentleness, meekness, and humility, starting today?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Claudia P.: ‚ÄúI praise God for His tender mercies are new not only every morning, but every moment! He has been good toward my family and me beyond what words can express. I praise you Lord!‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Rose K.: ‚ÄúPraise God for the 100 Days of Prayer! Every day I am prompted to do something new, or I see new changes in other believers. Afterward, I realize that what I saw was actually an answer to the prayer request in the 100 Days of Prayer. It is amazing to see how the Holy Spirit is working!‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Jesus to make you humble and meek.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for members in Uganda who are affected by recent floods. The flash floods have left many houses destroyed. Many are now homeless amidst the lockdown.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Adventist teachers around the world as many are facing financial difficulties due to not being able to work.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for young people to realize the importance of serving God and not the world.

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 59 - May 24 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:4</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe mourning here brought to view is true heart sorrow for sin . . . And as one is drawn to behold Jesus uplifted on the cross, he discerns the sinfulness of humanity. He sees that it is sin which scourged and crucified the Lord of glory. He sees that, while he has been loved with unspeakable tenderness, his life has been a continual scene of ingratitude and rebellion. He has forsaken his best Friend and abused heaven‚Äôs most precious gift. He has crucified to himself the Son of God afresh and pierced anew that bleeding and stricken heart. He is separated from God by a gulf of sin that is broad and black and deep, and he mourns in brokenness of heart. Such mourning ‚Äòshall be comforted.‚Äô God reveals to us our guilt that we may flee to Christ, and through Him be set free from the bondage of sin, and rejoice in the liberty of the sons of God. In true contrition we may come to the foot of the cross, and there leave our burdens.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, pp. 9-10</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever taken time to fully realize what Jesus accomplished for you in the darkest hours of His dying? As you behold the uplifted, crucified, sin-bearing Savior, will you let these scenes penetrate your heart? As you internalize His agony of experiencing the second death in your place, will you let it open your eyes to see the filthiness of your favorite sins? Why not today start mourning for your sins, especially for those which you have been unwilling to give up? Confess them to Jesus! He will gladly forgive you. He will comfort you. And He will give you victory.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Diane T.: ‚ÄúPraising God for the opportunity to attend the Virtual ARME Bible Camp! What a rich blessing during this time.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Iris R.: ‚ÄúI was addicted to binge-watching Netflix. I would read a few Bible verses and try to justify myself, and then continue watching. After a week of prayer at our school God convicted me to delete the app. After a while I went back on and started to watch only Bible movies, but I couldn‚Äôt control myself, I was back under Satan‚Äôs control. I cried out to God. The next day my pastor gave me as a present the Andrews Study Bible. I rejoiced, and with tears thanked God for His intervention. He reminded me of Philippians 2:13 ‚Äòfor it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.‚Äô I praise God for convicting me and fulfilling His promise.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a clearer understanding of what really happened at the cross. Pray for God to help you hate sin, and love righteousness.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the canvassing work in Malawi as well as for financial support to start a sanitarium and medical missionary work in that region.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that people won‚Äôt get derailed with conspiracy theories, but fix their eyes upon Jesus, and His truth.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the members of the Peter‚Äôs Rest Seventh-day Adventist Church on St. Croix, Virgin Islands. Their church building completely burned down. Pray for wisdom as to how to move forward. Pray that this loss will be turned into a victory for Jesus.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 58 - May 23 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù
<br>Matthew 5:3</p>

<p>‚ÄúThose who know that they cannot possibly save themselves, or of themselves do any righteous action, are the ones who appreciate the help that Christ can bestow. They are the poor in spirit, whom He declares to be blessed. Whom Christ pardons, He first makes penitent, and it is the office of the Holy Spirit to convince of sin. Those whose hearts have been moved by the convicting Spirit of God see that there is nothing good in themselves. They see that all they have ever done is mingled with self and sin. Like the poor publican, they stand afar off, not daring to lift up so much as their eyes to heaven, and cry, ‚ÄòGod, be merciful to me the sinner‚Äô. . . All who have a sense of their deep soul poverty, who feel that they have nothing good in themselves, may find righteousness and strength by looking unto Jesus.‚Äù
<br>Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, pp. 7-8</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Self-righteousness ‚Äì the all-permeating and often subconscious attitude that deceives us into thinking and feeling that we are good ‚Äì is the greatest hindrance in truly receiving personal salvation in Jesus. When we realize our spiritual poverty, our life-long, desperate need for Jesus, and as a result trust solely in Him, moment by moment, to fully and completely heal us from every last trace of selfishness, only then can we have the assurance of salvation.</p>

<p>Today, why not come to Jesus as you are, with your broken, sinful self? Why not claim only His blood, His life and death, as a means for salvation? Why not ask Him to uproot all self-reliance that is still in your heart and replace it with a faith in His ability to save you, and to empower you to do good works motivated by selfless love?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Nolubabalo D.: ‚ÄúThank you Lord for your hand over Africa. Thank you for your protection. Thank you for taking care of my kids in my absence. You are worthy of all praise.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Philippe M.: ‚ÄúIn our town of Kananga, there were no radio broadcasts before the Covid-19 lockdowns, but at this time of crisis we have four broadcasts each week on four local radio stations. We praise God for that!‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Jesus to cleanse you from all self-righteousness and give you a realization of your great daily and lifelong need of Him.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for evangelists in South Africa who are struggling with various health issues and stress. Pray that they will be healed and enabled to find ways to preach the gospel even now.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Brother Samuel S. He is suffering from excruciating pain in his lower body and doctors do not know what is wrong. Also, pray for Sister Tabitha N. who has been diagnosed with a hole in her heart and is in great pain. Pray for their healing and the healing of many others who are suffering at this time.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Chinese Ministry Center in Jakarta, Indonesia as they are conducting online evangelistic meetings every Sabbath from May 9 until June 20, 2020. The first meeting drew around 3000 viewers and more than 260 signed up for Bible studies.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 56 - May 21 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúFor though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them ‚Ä¶ I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some.‚Äù
‚Äì 1 Corinthians 9:19, 22b</p>

<p>‚ÄúEvery true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a missionary.‚Äù ‚Äì Desire of Ages, 195</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Missionary work, evangelism, these are not fields of service reserved only for the pastor or trained evangelist. Every believer, in whose heart Jesus dwells through the Spirit, is called to shine a light in this world through words of truth and actions of love.
Why not ask Christ right now to show you who and where your mission field is today? Plead for genuine compassion for lost souls and the courage to share your faith with love to the people in your sphere of influence.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Makoba Family: ‚ÄúThe 100 Days of Prayer have been a good experience for us as a family. Although the situation around us seems fearful, as a family we are taking this period to recommit our lives to Jesus by following the 100 Days of Prayer program seriously.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄòOne Year in Mission‚Äô youth team in Guwahati, India, was able to reach hundreds of Hindus with the health message just prior to the Covid-19 lock down.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for clarity as to what God‚Äôs mission for you is where you are at right now. Pray that God will help you to be faithful in sharing Christ with the people around you through your words, actions and conduct.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for all Adventist Hospitals as they have many needs during this crisis. Pray that the doctors and nurses and staff are empowered by the Holy Spirit to be witnesses to their patients.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the church‚Äôs ‚ÄòLife Hope Centers‚Äô around the world to be a beacon of light during these dark days.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for major cities in your territory and for God to give us a breakthrough in reaching the people in these places.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for frontline missionaries, especially in the 10/40 window who are seeking to bring Jesus into communities that have been ruled by Satan for thousands of years.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 52 - May 17 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúAaron spoke all the words that the Lord had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people. And the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.‚Äù ‚Äì Exodus 4:30-31</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou desire to give yourself to Him, but you are weak in moral power, in slavery to doubt, and controlled by the habits of your life of sin. Your promises and resolutions are like ropes of sand. You cannot control your thoughts, your impulses, your affections. The knowledge of your broken promises and forfeited pledges weakens your confidence in your own sincerity, and causes you to feel that God cannot accept you; but you need not despair. What you need to understand is the true force of the will. This is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of decision, or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs to exercise. You cannot change your heart, you cannot of yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You can give Him your will; He will then work in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus your whole nature will be brought under the control of the Spirit of Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him, your thoughts will be in harmony with Him.‚Äù ‚Äì Steps to Christ, 47</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When faced with the reality of God‚Äôs loving promise of salvation from slavery, the people of Israel‚Äôs reaction was one of surrender, commitment and worship.</p>

<p>As you contemplate God‚Äôs incredible love for you, will you choose today to respond to Him with the same kind of attitude? Will you give Him your will, your life, your heart?</p>

<p>God is good. He desires to help and heal. The process can hurt at times, but it is worth it. Why not let go of the world, surrender, and commit your life and will to God today and worship Him?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Covid-19 restrictions have led to an increase of interest in the gospel in the Middle East. Various individuals, while staying anonymous have connected online with the church.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Massive prayer movements are taking place in the Inter-American Division.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Literature Evangelists around the world who are financially affected by the pandemic. Pray for ways for our literature to still spread during this time and for many to be blessed by reading them.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those faithful members who are serving with food banks at this time. Pray that they are protected from the virus as they do this service of love for their communities.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for laymen, Bible workers, and evangelists who are dependent on farming and other self-supportive measures to sustain themselves and their families. Pray for those living and serving in regions that are affected by heavy droughts.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 51 - May 16 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúGod shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.‚Äù
‚Äì Romans 5:8</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs soon as there was sin, there was a Saviour. Christ knew that He would have to suffer, yet He became man‚Äôs substitute. As soon as Adam sinned, the Son of God presented Himself as surety for the human race.‚Äù ‚Äì In Heavenly Places, 13.2</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>When Adam and Eve sinned it was God who, despite having been rejected and sinned against, took the first step towards humanity. He came with an attitude of grace, forgiveness and with the promise, that Jesus will crush the serpent Satan (Genesis 3:15) and become the Sacrifice for their salvation. Christ is still walking towards you with that same attitude. He is committed to you and your salvation. Will you run into His loving arms today and accept His cleansing blood and His righteousness?</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you.‚Äù
‚Äì Jeremiah 31:3</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Father loves us, not because of the great propitiation, but He provided the propitiation because He loves us. Christ was the medium through which He could pour out His infinite love upon a fallen world. ‚ÄòGod was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.‚Äô 2 Corinthians 5:19. . .Such love is without a parallel. Children of the heavenly King! Precious promise! Theme for the most profound meditation! The matchless love of God for a world that did not love Him!‚Äù
‚Äì Steps to Christ, p. 13, 15</p>

<p>Weekly Devotional: <strong>Transformed by God's Love</strong></p>
<p>_by Derek Morris_</p>

<p>Mary Ann Roberts grew up in a Christian home, but as a young person she never made a personal commitment to Jesus as her Savior and Lord. After college she married, her husband joined the military, and they moved to Europe. It was there that Mary Ann abandoned all connections with church and became a self-described party animal.</p>

<p>In 1983 she hit rock bottom. In the midst of a weekend-long drinking binge she became so drunk and sick that she was unable to attend a family reunion. That‚Äôs when Mary Ann decided to ask God back into her life. The vivid picture that came to her mind at that low point in her life was of a loving Father running down the road to meet His prodigal child. Mary Ann knew she was that child.</p>

<p>Realizing that she needed to make some radical changes in her lifestyle, she wrote to a Christian pastor and told him of her commitment to become a follower of Jesus. That pastor‚Äôs wife understood how difficult the transition would be and supported Mary Ann by calling her on the telephone every single morning for an entire year to pray with her.</p>

<p>Even though Mary Ann started attending a Christian church and God became a vital part of her life, she sensed that something was still missing‚Äîthat God had something special in store for her that she had not yet discovered. She always wished that she had continued her education, and decided to go back to school. Perhaps it would fill the void in her heart. She applied to and was accepted into a graduate program in science and eventually completed a Ph.D. in neuroscience. But somehow life still seemed incomplete.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2001, Mary Ann attended a campmeeting in North Carolina. She was mainly interested in socializing with friends, so she sat near the back of the auditorium. During one of the meetings though, she overhead a Christian evangelist invite those who were interested in a ministry project in Kenya to meet with him after the service.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUsually I like to mull things over before I act,‚Äù Mary Ann recalls, ‚Äúbut it was as if someone were standing in front of me and pointing directly at me.‚Äù At the close of the meeting she walked up to the front of the auditorium under deep conviction that God was calling her to participate in the ministry project in Kenya. After talking with Mary Ann, the evangelist invited her to conduct a series of meetings in the primitive community of Rongo, Kenya. Mary Ann was not a public speaker. She had no homiletics training and absolutely no experience in frontline mission work. It had never crossed her mind that God would ask her to become a preacher. But she was open to the working of the Holy Spirit that day, and, in her own words, she began to pray a very radical prayer: ‚ÄúLord, I give You permission to throw me out into your harvest.‚Äù</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months and Mary Ann traveled to Kenya to do just what God had called her to do. Although she was terrified, every night when she stood up to preach, she sensed God speaking through her to the crowd assembled in the town square. At the end of her meetings more than 500 people confessed their love for Jesus in baptism. As you can imagine, Mary Ann was filled with joy‚Äîradical joy! And that joy has not disappeared. Mary Ann has continued to preach, share God‚Äôs love, and follow His leading. She found her calling when she gave God permission to use her in His harvest.</p>

<p>Will you give God permission to use you in His harvest? It might not look the same as it did three months ago, before the COVID-19 crisis hit. But there is still much to do, and many souls waiting to hear the good news! Pray and ask Him what He would have you to do!</p>

<p>_Derek Morris is president of Hope Channel International. For more inspiration like this, we encourage you to read our featured book of the week by Derek Morris titled *The Radical Prayer* from which this week‚Äôs devotional has been taken._</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p> 
<p>What about our life today? Have we given God permission to use us in His harvest? If we feel distant from God, let‚Äôs remember that He‚Äôs waiting with open arms of love for us to turn to Him. He not only wants to welcome us home, but He also has a special place of service for each of us. Will we open our hearts to His call?</p>

<p><strong>ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE: </strong></p>
<p>Look around for the different ways God is showing you His love. Perhaps you will see His love through others, through nature, or by some other means. When you discover His love in a unique way, write it down, then share it with two people this week as you claim John 15:12. Make it a habit to look for God‚Äôs love and for unique ways that you can share His love with others.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Elizabeth W.: ‚ÄúI praise God for His healing power!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Member in the U.K.: ‚ÄúPraise God for hearing our prayer and miraculously providing food and financial help just at the right time. Also, for healing my back problems!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Scientists are eagerly working on finding a vaccination and remedies that help to slow down the virus. Much progress has been made and there is hope!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a willing heart to be used by God whenever and wherever He calls.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray all the online evangelism and digital church activities will be utilized and greatly blessed.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for young people who are in the valley of decision for or against Christ. Pray that they will experience the love and truth of Jesus and gladly serve Him all their lives.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the many church groups around the world who don‚Äôt have a building to meet in and are seeking to find land. Pray also for God to awaken all members to engage in church-planting activities.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 49 - May 14 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>üí° Study verse: The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.‚Äù ‚Äì (Psalm 116:5)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúThe souls who came to Jesus felt in His presence that even for them there was escape from the pit of sin. The Pharisees had only scorn and condemnation for them; but Christ greeted them as children of God, estranged indeed from the Father‚Äôs house, but not forgotten by the Father‚Äôs heart. And their very misery and sin made them only the more the objects of His compassion. The farther they had wandered from Him, the more earnest the longing and the greater the sacrifice for their rescue.‚Äù ‚Äì COL 186.2</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>God‚Äôs grace to us is a direct result of His great compassion towards all who suffer under sin and its consequences. Realizing His compassion towards you, as revealed in Jesus, what is hindering you to come to Him, as you are, and surrender the darkest corners of your life to Him, today? Jesus understands your burdens, struggles, and temptations. He is more than willing to help, heal, forgive, uplift, and strengthen you. Will you let His love, grace and compassion melt any resistance or indifference you might be feeling towards Him today?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>Many Adventists and other Christians are realizing we had become too comfortable and were running our churches too humanly. We needed a wakeup call to help us live the life of faith, prayer, and miracles like the early church did in Acts. At that time believers had no finances, degrees, buildings or institutions, yet because of the trials and even persecution and by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit they changed the world and took the gospel to the whole world in just a few years.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER FOCUS:</strong></p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the churches in Jamaica. Pray for members who are facing financial difficulties as well as the Andrews Memorial Hospital staff and patients during this crisis.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members and family members who are struggling with addictions to pornography, alcohol, sugar, movies, music, and other substances and behaviors. Pray for them to gain victory in Christ.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the Windhoek South Church in Namibia who has been trying for ten years to receive approval to buy land to build a church for them to meet in.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the Adventist bakery in Gr√§nna, Sweden, to be able to reach the many people in their city with the gospel message.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 48 - May 13 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúNevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.‚Äù ‚Äì John 16:7</p>

<p>‚ÄúLo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 28:20</p>

<p>‚ÄúHenceforth through the Spirit, Christ was to abide continually in the hearts of His children. Their union with Him was closer than when He was personally with them. The light, and love, and power of the indwelling Christ shone out through them, so that men, beholding, ‚Äòmarveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.‚Äô Acts 4:13.‚Äù ‚ÄìSteps to Christ, p. 74.1</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wished to be alive during the time when Jesus was on Earth? To walk and talk with Him? The powerful goal of the gospel is to give you something even better! Jesus wants to live inside of you, making you like Him through the transformational ministry of the Holy Spirit. Have you asked Jesus to baptize you with the Holy Spirit so that His presence would be felt and seen in you? Jesus told us to ask for the gift of His Spirit daily (Luke 11:13). Why not invite Christ to dwell in you through His Spirit right now?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ So many, many around us are open and receptive to our witness and understandings of Scripture because of this crisis. Praise God He is saving many for eternity with Him during this pestilence!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for individuals dealing with demonic oppression and possession. Pray that they will be released from Satan‚Äôs power. Pray for their families, especially children whose parents are affected.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the thousands of new groups and churches planted around the world to remain strong and vibrant despite the current crisis.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for pastors and church leaders in countries with very poor healthcare.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Adventist radio stations around the world, reaching the unreached.</p>

<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.‚Äù ‚Äì John 15:9</p>

<p>‚ÄúI shall, if saved in the kingdom of God, be constantly discerning new depths in the plan of salvation. All the redeemed saints will see and appreciate, as never before, the love of the Father and the Son, and songs of praise will burst forth from immortal tongues. He loved us, He gave His life for us. With glorified bodies, with enlarged capacities, with hearts made pure, with lips undefiled, we shall sing the riches of redeeming love.‚Äù ‚Äì Letter 27, 1890</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>God is love. He is the Originator of love. There can be no purer love than the love within the Godhead. If Jesus loves us as much as the Father loves Jesus, what could possibly be more attractive than being with Him in full harmony? Jesus‚Äô love is without comparison!</p>
<p>Are there currently things in your life that you love more than Jesus? Is there something that has captivated the affections of your heart?</p>
<p>Ask Jesus to impress you with the perfect love with which you are loved by Him. Why not choose today to accept this love into your heart and make it the supreme motivation for your walk of faith?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Some countries and some states in the U.S. have begun to reopen businesses (with restrictions).</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Covid-19 case rates and death rates have been somewhat lower than earlier projections predicted.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for various building projects such as churches and schools around the world. Pray for continued sacrificial giving and faithfulness in tithes and offering.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines who are facing one of the worst droughts on top of the pandemic. Pray for rain, and God‚Äôs blessings on the mission of the local churches.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for members who are plagued by fear during this crisis.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for discernment in understanding the difference between adherence to sanitary measures promoted by the government and enforcement of false worship.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 45 - May 10 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúSeeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.‚Äù ‚Äì Hebrews 4:14-16</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Son of God ... has fulfilled His pledge, and has passed into the heavens, to take upon Him the government of the heavenly host. He fulfilled one phase of His priesthood by dying on the cross for the fallen race. He is now fulfilling another phase by pleading before the Father the case of the repenting, believing sinner, presenting to God the offerings of His people. Having taken human nature, and in this nature having overcome the temptations of the enemy, and having divine perfection, to Him has been committed the judgment of the world. The case of each one will be brought in review before Him. He will pronounce judgment, rendering to every man according to his works.‚Äù ‚Äì Manuscript 42, 1901</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Jesus became human, died, and resurrected, and is right now standing in the heavenly sanctuary as a representative to all who have surrendered their lives to Him. When you pray, He is listening. When you seek forgiveness for sins, and victory, He hears you and will supply instantly the power needed to overcome.
As we live in the light of the judgment, have you made Jesus, the compassionate High Priest, your Advocate (1 John 2:1)? Have you sought refuge in His righteousness? Will you let Him not only cover you in His righteousness, but also fill you with His righteousness by doing the works He has prepared for you (Ephesians 2:10)?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Sheril M.: ‚ÄúI thank God! The ‚Äò100 Days of Prayer‚Äô have strengthened my faith in this hard time.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Rose S.: ‚ÄúBecause of this pandemic our ‚ÄòPower of Prayer Chat Group‚Äô became more alive as we have more time to pray together virtually, 5-6 times daily!‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the homeless people in all regions of the world who are relying on the greater population for help but are now in desperate need due to lockdowns.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for elderly members who are not able to connect with their families during this crisis. Pray for those who are struggling with dementia and are very confused during this time.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for marriages who are currently under extra pressure. Pray that struggling spouses will find healing, help and humility as they focus on Jesus.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.‚Äù ‚Äì John 17:3</p>

<p>‚ÄúChrist came to reveal God to the world as a God of love, full of mercy, tenderness, and compassion. The thick darkness with which Satan had endeavored to enshroud the throne of Deity was swept away by the world‚Äôs Redeemer, and the Father was again manifest to men as the light of life.‚Äù ‚Äì 5T 738.4</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Eternal life is not just simply about living forever, but eternal life is the continual deepening of your love relationship with God. Do you mostly know facts about Jesus, or do you know Him personally as your Savior and Friend?</p>
</p>Why not start eternity today by asking Jesus to reveal Himself on a deeper level to you, as you spend time in prayer, the Bible and in sharing His love and truth with others?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
<p>‚Ä¢ Thierry T.: ‚ÄúI am sharing the ‚Äò100 Days of Prayer‚Äô with 90 of my friends. I was also able to share the book ‚ÄòGreat Controversy‚Äô to many of my contacts. One non-Adventist asked me to study the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation with him.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Gloria D.: ‚ÄúGod has blessed us to be able to run our food distribution program in spite of this pandemic.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you. Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is an everlasting rock.‚Äù ‚Äì Isaiah 26:3-4 (ESV)</p>

<p>‚ÄúThose who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest.‚Äù ‚Äì Desire of Ages, p. 331</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>When you feel unrest in your heart, where do you run first?</p>
<p>Who do you consult? Is it Jesus?</p>
<p>Putting our trust in Jesus, Our Everlasting Rock, cannot be based on how you feel in any particular moment. You must choose to trust Him, no matter what circumstances you are in. Then He can give you perfect peace. Will you choose to put your trust in Him right now?</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 41 - May 6 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>What do you long for most? What is your deepest heart cry? Perhaps you haven‚Äôt thought about this recently. Perhaps you are just trying to survive. Or perhaps you think about it all the time. Take a few moments today to think about where you find your greatest joy and your greatest fulfillment. As you do, reflect on Psalm 27:4, and ask the Lord to give you a heart that truly hungers to be in His presence.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.‚Äù (2 Cor. 4:7-10)</p>

<p>‚ÄúFrom the secret place of prayer came the power that shook the world in the Great Reformation. There, with holy calmness, the servants of the Lord set their feet upon the rock of His promises. During the struggle at Augsburg, Luther ‚Äòdid not pass a day without devoting three hours at least to prayer, and they were hours selected from those the most favorable to study.‚Äô In the privacy of his chamber he was heard to pour out his soul before God in words ‚Äòfull of adoration, fear, and hope, as when one speaks to a friend.‚Äô ‚ÄòI know that Thou art our Father and our God,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòand that Thou wilt scatter the persecutors of Thy children; for Thou art Thyself endangered with us. All this matter is Thine, and it is only by Thy constraint that we have put our hands to it. Defend us, then, O Father!‚Äô‚Äù
(Great Controversy, p. 210)</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
<p>Praise God that Adventist members and churches have been asking God for creative ways to reach their communities around them. And that God is answering these prayers with many creative approaches.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER FOCUS:</strong></p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the elderly and for children ‚Äì the most vulnerable among us.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members who are learning how to build friendships with Muslim refugees who have recently relocated to their neighborhoods. Pray for wisdom on how to lead them to the truth.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for churches worldwide to have the faith to start urban centers of influence in cities near them.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for the Latter Rain outpouring on the church, that the work can be finished so we can go home.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 40 - May 5 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed.‚Äù John 20:29</p>

<p>‚ÄúFaith takes God at His word, with or without feeling. It is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.‚Äô We can believe our fellowmen, and can we not trust the word of God? When we go to Him for wisdom or grace, we are not to look to ourselves to see if He has given us a special feeling as an assurance that He has fulfilled His word. Feeling is no criterion. Great evils have resulted when Christians have followed feeling. How do I know that Jesus hears my prayers?‚ÄîI know it by His promise.</p>

<p>He says He will hear the needy when they cry unto Him, and I believe His word. He has never said to the ‚Äòseed of Jacob, seek ye Me in vain.‚Äô If we walk in the light, we may come to the throne of grace with holy boldness. We may present the promises of God in living faith, and urge our petitions. Although we are weak, and erring, and unworthy, ‚Äòthe Spirit helpeth our infirmities.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ When we have offered our petition once, we must not then abandon it, but say, as did Jacob when he wrestled all night with the angel, ‚ÄòI will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me,‚Äô and like him we shall prevail.‚Äù Bible Echo, September 24, 1894, par. 6</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs one thing to believe when the miracle is standing in front of you, when you can see it with your own eyes. But what about the times we don‚Äôt see the answers, we don‚Äôt see the miracles, we don‚Äôt see angels, and we don‚Äôt see God‚Äôs goodness in our life? Will we still faithfully trust God even then, even when we don‚Äôt understand? As you ponder these questions, look up Hebrews 11:1, Romans 8:24-25, Mark 9:24, Job 13:15</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
<p>Praise the Lord that in many places the number of new cases of COVID19 is decreasing.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Requests:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray as nations and economies open up that there will not be renewed dramatic increases in the number of infections.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Chinese ministry in Cebu City and in all of the Philippines and Indonesia for the protection from the coronavirus and for more Chinese people in every country to have more interest in seeking Jesus and the truths of the Bible.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that the nation of China with 1.4 billion people would become very open to the spread of the gospel.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that we all would use the extra time we have at home to study deeply in the Bible and teach our children how to study and love God‚Äôs Word.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 38 - May 3 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBut Jesus looked at them and said, ‚ÄòWith men it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are possible.‚Äô‚Äù Mark 10:27</p>

<p>‚ÄúNatural impossibilities cannot prevent the working of the Omnipotent One.‚Äù Desire of Ages, p. 535</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe have a God whose ear is not closed to our petitions; and if we prove His word, he will honor our faith. He wants us to have all our interests interwoven with his interests, and then he can safely bless us; for we shall not then take glory to self when the blessing is ours, but shall render all the praise to God.‚Äù Review and Herald, June 9, 1891</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Often times our faith in God is small because we don‚Äôt really recognize the magnitude of our God. We think our problems are so big that He cannot solve them. We forget that we serve the God who stretched out the heavens by His great power and there‚Äôs nothing too hard for Him. Today, take some time to reflect on the greatness of God. Write down characteristics and attributes that God alone holds. As you do this simple activity, ask God to increase your understanding and comprehension of who He really is.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
<p>We praise the Lord that many of God‚Äôs people are expressing faith in His leading and are looking for open doors of opportunity instead of just focusing on doors that may have been shut during this pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Requests:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that people will ask God about this crises situation ‚Äì ‚ÄúIs God trying to tell us something? (1 Samuel 3:10)</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for many people in the poorest countries who have no work and are having trouble getting even basic food like rice and maize flour. Many are in danger of starving.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for open hearts of people around the world ‚Äì to give, to help, and to pray for those who are in crises. (Proverbs 22:9, Psalm 86:6-7)</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for farmers who are struggling to plant or harvest crops and for support workers to stay well.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 34 - April 29</p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion. Declare among the people his doings. When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.‚Äù Ps. 9:9-12</p>

<p>‚ÄúAn earnest prayer offered from a contrite heart by one who desires to do the Master‚Äôs will is of more value in God‚Äôs sight than is eloquence of speech. The human agent may have no voice in legislative councils, he may not be permitted to deliberate in senates or vote in parliaments, yet he has access to God. The King of kings bends low to listen to the prayer coming from a humble, contrite heart. God hears every prayer that is offered with the incense of faith. The weakest child of God may exert an influence in harmony with the councils of heaven.‚Äù That I May Know Him, p. 270</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>As one author likes to say, ‚ÄúPride doesn‚Äôt listen. It already knows.‚Äù Are there ways that perhaps you‚Äôve allowed pride to influence your listening skills? Are there ways perhaps that you‚Äôve allowed pride to rule your tongue, or even dictate your prayers? If so, pray that God would show you how to ask forgiveness from those whom your prideful ways of speaking and living may have wounded. This is tough, but if God is to hear our prayers, we must put away pride, both between ourselves and especially against Him.
(Look up James 4:10, Isa. 57:15)</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
<p>We praise God that He is in control of this world and He still sits on the thrown. Although life seems out of control right now for many of us, we can rest in the security of the everlasting arms who promises He will never leave us or forsake us. Remember, He saw all this COVID19 pandemic before it came upon our world, and nothing touches us unless He allows it. So if we are struggling with sickness, with financial loss, or other trials and pain‚Äîlet‚Äôs praise God that He‚Äôs still on the throne and what the enemy means for evil He can turn to good.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those especially who have no voice to fight for themselves or get the help they need during this crisis.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the children, the elderly, the vulnerable, and the single mothers struggling to survive.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the refugee populations camped throughout Europe, Greece, and other countries around the world. Pray for provision for their needs, for healthcare, and for their rights as human beings to be upheld.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Continue to pray for the many missionaries that are huddling down at their posts of duty in various places around the world. Pray for provision for their physical needs and safety.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for continued strength and rehabilitation for those who have recovered from the Coronavirus. Pray for healing for lungs, and strength to return to normal life.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 33 - April 28</p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúI sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto Him, and were lightened: and their faces we're not ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that fear him, and delivereth them.‚Äù Psalms. 34:4-7</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe have too little faith. We limit the Holy One of Israel. We should be grateful God condescends to use any of us as His instruments. For every earnest prayer put up in faith for anything, answers will be returned. They may not come just as we expected; but they will come‚Äînot perhaps as we have devised, but at the very time when we need them most.‚Äù Gospel Workers, p. 92</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps as you look around your social circle you see some that are really struggling in their faith. Why don‚Äôt you think about some practical ways to share faith with a brother or sister in need. Perhaps share a good book (or recommend a good book) that builds faith like ‚ÄúA Thousand Shall Fall‚Äù or ‚ÄúOne Miracle after Another.‚Äù When we see how God has worked miracles in the lives of others, we can have confidence for our own life today. Or perhaps write a card with some Bible promises and give it to someone in need. If you aren‚Äôt sure who to reach out to, ask God and He will show you!</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
<p>In the Philippines, as a result of this pandemic, hundreds of young people are praying together each day over Zoom, and many hearts are being broken and drawn closer to Jesus. We just praise the Lord for the spirit of prayer growing everywhere. Many are earnestly seeking a deeper understanding of God‚Äôs Word as well.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for your local pastor. Pray that God would sustain Him, protect Him, and most importantly, fill Him with am even more abundant outpouring of the Holy Spirit</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for our General Conference church leadership, administrators, departmental directors and staff. Pray for God to give them wisdom as they seek to lead and promote the mission of the church throughout this crisis.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray specifically for Ted Wilson, General Conference president, GT. Ng, secretary, and Juan Prestol, treasurer. Pray for special wisdom for them, protection for their families, and Holy Spirit blessing as they lead us through this crisis.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God‚Äôs leading for the future of our church. Pray that we would not waste this opportunity to share the love of Jesus and the beautiful truths of Revelation 14 and 18, with the world in need.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray earnestly that the Latter Rain would come as God has promised, so the work could be finished and we could go home. It‚Äôs not longer time for business as usual. It‚Äôs time to finish the work and get ready to meet Jesus.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 32 - April 27</p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúAs His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who has me us by glory and virtue, by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.‚Äù 2 Peter. 1:3-4</p>

<p>‚ÄúEvery promise in the Word of God is for us. In your prayers, present the pledge word of Jehovah and by faith claim His promises. His Word is the assurance that if you ask in faith, you will receive all spiritual blessings. Continue to ask, and you will receive exceedingly abundantly above all that you ask or think. Educate yourself to have unlimited confidence in God. Cast all your care upon Him. Wait patiently for Him, and He will bring it to pass.‚Äù
In Heavenly Places, p. 71</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>What does it mean to have unlimited confidence in God and His Word? If every promise in the Word is indeed for us, as we are told, why are we still so often very reluctant to take God at His Word? What are some ways we could change our prayers of faltering doubt to prayers of confident faith? (Hint: Look up John 6:37, Heb. 11:6, and Rom. 10:17)</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
<p>We praise the Lord for working out the technical issues with the HOPE AWAKENS series with It Is Written. We continue to pray for God‚Äôs provision and protection over this series.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who are currently listening and watching the ‚ÄúHope Awakens‚Äù series with It is Written. Pray that many hearts and lives will be forever changed.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who are fighting COVID-19. Pray that God would give them the breath of healing physically and spiritually.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for all the frontline and essential workers, from medical staff to grocery store employees, and delivery services. Pray that God‚Äôs protecting hand would be over them as they serve others and keep our essential businesses open.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the elderly who are stuck in nursing homes where family cannot visit. Some cannot understand why this is the case. Pray that God‚Äôs sustaining grace would be with them</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who are struggling with anxiety, fear, and especially for those who live alone. If you know someone who fits the above criteria, pray for a way to reach out to them and show care‚Äîin a socially safe and appropriate way.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 31 - April 26</p>
<p>üìú </p>

<p>Prayer is a heaven-ordained means of success. Appeals, petitions, entreaties, between man and man, move men and act a part in controlling the affairs of nations. But prayer moves heaven‚Ä¶ Prayer, faith, confidence in God, bring a divine power that sets human calculations at their real worth‚Äînothingness‚Ä¶ He who places himself where God can enlighten him, advances, as it were, from the partial obscurity of dawn to the full radiance of noonday.‚Äù In Heavenly Places, p. 75</p>

<p>As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord shall save me. Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.‚Äù Ps. 55:16-18</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>What is the most impossible thing that you are praying God will do? Is it to bring reconciliation between you and someone you love? Is it to restore a broken marriage, or bring a child back to the faith? Write down several impossible prayers on your heart today, and then beside those prayers, write down specific promises from God‚Äôs Word. Start by claiming the following promises: Mark 10:27, Luke 18:27, 1 John 5:14</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>We praise the Lord that God has already used this COVID-19 pandemic to bring reconciliation between many, and we know God is longing to work the same miracle of healing for many more.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for our church members across the different countries of Africa, the islands of the Caribbean, and the countries of central and south America as they are fighting the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those in your own church and community who are being impacted by the financial crisis. Pray that their needs would be met.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a generous heart to share if you happen to be someone with extra resource. Pray that we as a church family would stand together with our brothers and sisters in need.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that God would take us deeper in our devotional time with Him, not just to gain help and blessings, but that our greatest desire would be to truly know Him.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that church members worldwide will take advantage of this time to eagerly share spiritual resources, the It Is Written ‚ÄúHope Awakens‚Äù series, or other spiritual food with neighbors and friends in need.</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 29 - April 24</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Always Open</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúYou need not go to the ends of the earth for wisdom, for God is near. It is not the capabilities you now possess or ever will have that will give you success. It is that which the Lord can do for you. We need to have far less confidence in what man can do and far more confidence in what God can do for every believing soul. He longs to have you reach after Him by faith. He longs to have you expect great things from Him.‚Äù (Christ Object Lessons, p. 146)</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong> </p>
<p>Have your spiritual shelves gotten a little bare in some areas due to the busyness and hurry of life the last few years? Perhaps there are some heavenly supplies and graces that you need to stock up on? Furthermore, if you could ask for any spiritual gift, for victory in any specific area, or for some other spiritual blessing, what would you ask for? Think about these questions for a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE:</strong></p>
<p>Why don‚Äôt you take time to write down the things you feel in need of this week‚Äîthen look up specific Bible promises where God tells us that He will supply that specific need. Whether it‚Äôs money to pay the bills, or strength in an area where you‚Äôve been spiritually weak, start actively claiming the promises of God when you pray.</p>

<p><strong>Motivational - "Always Open"</strong> by Randy Maxwell</p>

<p>A few Sundays back, Suzette and I were tired of being cooped up in the house so we decided to drive down to The Landing‚Äîan outdoor shopping plaza in Renton, Washington, where we live, with stores, restaurants, services, and a multi-screen movie theater.</p>

<p>The eyeglass store I intended to visit had a sign on the door saying that, due to COVID-19, they were closed until further notice. But that wasn‚Äôt the only one. I drove around to the Ross store‚Äîclosed. Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods‚Äîclosed. Marshall‚Äôs‚Äîclosed. World Market‚Äîclosed. The parking lot was a ghost town. The invisible virus was demonstrating its power to make cars and shoppers disappear.</p>

<p>Just a few days earlier, Governor Jay Inslee had issued a stay-at-home order that essentially closed down the entire state of Washington. So it is under this order that I‚Äôm writing this devotional. That‚Äôs why I appreciate an encounter Jesus had with a doubting truth-seeker named Nathanael.</p>

<p>Jesus was heading to Galilee. On the way, he asked Philip to follow him. Philip then went to find his friend, Nathanael, and told him, ‚ÄúWe have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote‚ÄîJesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.‚Äù John 1:45</p>

<p>The mention of Nazareth invoked the same reaction in Nathanael that people have today at the mention of coronavirus‚Äîit closed things down. ‚ÄúNazareth! Can anything good come from there?‚Äù Nathanael asked. We might ask, can anything good come from this coronavirus? From the inconvenience and disruption of social distancing? From the inability of congregations to assemble in their houses of worship? But sometimes good things come from bad places or experiences.</p>

<p>To Nathanael‚Äôs credit, he responded to Philip‚Äôs invitation to ‚Äúcome and see‚Äù and went with him. Jesus saw Nathanael approaching and said, ‚ÄúHere is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you know me?‚Äù Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, ‚ÄúI saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.‚Äù John 1:48 Instantly, faith opened Nathanael‚Äôs closed mind and he confessed: ‚ÄúRabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.‚Äù (vs. 49)</p>

<p>‚ÄúJesus said, ‚ÄòYou believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.‚Äô He then added, ‚ÄòI tell you the truth you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.‚Äù (vs. 50-51)</p>

<p>At Jesus‚Äô baptism, ‚Äúheaven was opened,‚Äù and God anointed and verbally blessed His Son. (See Matt. 3:16-17.) ‚ÄúHere Christ virtually says, ‚ÄòOn the bank of the Jordan the heavens were opened, and the Spirit descended like a dove upon Me. That scene was but a token that I am the Son of God. If you believe on Me as such, your faith shall be quickened. You shall see that the heavens are opened and are never to be closed. I have opened them to you. The angels of God are ascending, bearing the prayers of the needy and distressed to the Father above, and descending, bring blessing and hope, courage, help, and life, to the children of men.‚Äô‚Äù (Desire of Ages, p. 142, 143)</p>

<p>Hallelujah! Heaven is open! Heaven is always open, and nothing‚Äînot prejudice, or doubt, or COVID-19, or stay-at-home orders, or demons, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation can shut its doors. (See Rom. 8:39.) And what does it mean for heaven to be open? It means, you and I have full and complete access to everything that‚Äôs there, and the ‚Äúshelves‚Äù are always stocked with everything we need.</p>

<p><strong>What is in stock in heaven?</strong></p>
<p>Everything we need for life and godliness (2 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>The fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22, 23).</p>
<p>The full armor of God (Eph. 6:14-17).</p>
<p>Exceeding great and precious promises (2 Pet.1:4).</p>
<p>New birth into a living hope (1Pet. 1:3-5).</p>
<p>The mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16).</p>
<p>Every spiritual blessing in Christ (Eph. 1:3).</p>

<p>Heaven is open and Jesus has given us the keys to the kingdom (Matt. 16:19). That key is prayer. The angels are heaven‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù delivery agents, bearing our prayers up to the Father and descending, bringing the blessings we need most‚Äîhope, courage, help, and life to us.</p>

<p>The Landing may be closed, basketball may be closed, hockey may be closed, restaurants may be closed, even our churches may be temporarily closed, but Heaven is always open. So don‚Äôt be afraid. Jesus says, ‚ÄúYou may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it‚Äù John 14:14. Therefore, ‚ÄúOpen your mouth wide and I will fill it.‚Äù Ps. 81:10</p>

<p>This Coronavirus can‚Äôt stop God. Pray as never before, because Heaven is always open.</p>

<p>Randy Maxwell is the pastor of the Renton Seventh-day Adventist Church in Renton, Washington, where he lives with his wife, Suzette. He‚Äôs the author of ‚ÄúIf My People Pray‚Äù and ‚ÄúBootcamp for the Last Days.‚Äù</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 28 - April 23</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Strengthen through the Word</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúFor the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.‚Äù Hebrews 4:12</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, that men would fear the Lord! Oh, that they would love the Lord! Oh, that the messengers of God would feel the burden of perishing souls! Then they would not merely speechify; but they would have the power of God vitalizing their souls, and their hearts would glow with the fire of God‚Äôs love. Out of weakness they would become strong; for they would be doers of the word. They would hear the voice of Jesus: ‚ÄúLo, I am with you alway.‚Äù Jesus would be their teacher; and the word they minister would be quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword.‚Äù Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. 143</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>As you reflect on Hebrews 4:12, how do you see the Word of God piercing your own heart? Have you been convicted by something you‚Äôve read in God‚Äôs Word recently? Have you acted on your conviction, or have you pushed the promptings of the Holy Spirit aside? Share your thoughts with someone. Then pray that we as a people would not only hear the Word and love the Word, but that we would also seek to live according to the Word.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
<p>We praise the Lord in faith for the rich harvest of souls that He‚Äôs going to bring in response to the ‚ÄúHope Awakens‚Äù evangelistic event. We praise the Lord for the decisions that have already been made for Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those that are in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis, who are either struggling themselves, or have loved ones struggling with the illness.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for peace for church members around the world who fearful and afraid, or who are feeling alone.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the millions struggling throughout the Middle East, in countries like Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pray that in the midst of this crisis, God would open many hearts to the truth.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the new plans being organized for the rescheduled General Conference Session which will now take place May 20-25, 2021, in Indianapolis. Pray that the session will be filled with spiritual, mission-focused plans and that the Holy Spirit will be in full control.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Latter Rain outpouring on the church, that the work can be finished so we can go home.</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 27 - April 22</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Filled by the Word</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúOne thing I have desired of the LORD, That will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD, And to inquire in His temple.‚Äù Psalm. 27:4</p>

<p>‚ÄúI have a risen Saviour. In Him I trust, and He will never suffer me to be confounded. In His name I triumph. He is my righteousness and my crown of rejoicing. Let no one here feel that his case is hopeless, for it is not. You may see that you are sinful and undone, but it is just on this account that you need a Saviour. If you have sins to confess, lose no time. These moments are golden. ‚ÄòIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.‚Äô 1 John 1:9. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness will be filled, for Jesus has promised it. Precious Saviour! His arms are open to receive us, and His great heart of love is waiting to bless us.‚Äù Counsels for the Church, p. 48</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>What do you long for most? What is your deepest heart cry? Perhaps you haven‚Äôt thought about this recently. Perhaps you are just trying to survive. Or perhaps you think about it all the time. Take a few moments today to think about where you find your greatest joy and your greatest fulfillment. As you do, reflect on Psalm 27:4, and ask the Lord to give you a heart that truly hungers to be in His presence.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong> </p>
<p>A Coronavirus video for the deaf has been produced by the West Africa Division in Abidjan, CoÃÇte d‚ÄôIvoire, providing important information on COVID-19 through signing and subtitles. We are thankful for these new resources being developed to reach all demographic groups.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that God would take care of His children in North Korea, South Korea, Japan and China. Pray for all eyes, even those of government officials, to turn heavenward as they recognize the signs of the times, and that Jesus is coming back soon.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those that are part of the Possibilities Ministries. Pray for those that work among the deaf, the handicapped, and other special need ministries. Pray for those in the leprosy colonies, that they would not be ignored or forgotten during this time.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that as we recognize the nearness of Jesus coming we would all take time to seek Him with all our hearts and dig deeply in His Word. Pray that we would grasp the beautiful deep truths of Bible books like Daniel and Revelation.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the missionaries that are huddling down at their posts of duty in various places around the world. Pray for provision for their physical needs and protection.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for continued strength and rehabilitation for those who have recovered from the Coronavirus. Pray for ability to regain strength and return to normal life.</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 26 - April 21</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Guided by the Word</strong></p>
	
<p>‚ÄúWe are living in the most solemn period of this world‚Äôs history. The destiny of earth‚Äôs teeming multitudes is about to be decided. Our own future well-being and also the salvation of other souls depend upon the course which we now pursue. We need to be guided by the Spirit of truth. Every follower of Christ should earnestly inquire: ‚ÄúLord, what wilt Thou have me to do?‚Äù We need to humble ourselves before the Lord, with fasting and prayer, and to meditate much upon His Word, especially upon the scenes of the judgment.</p>

<p>We should now seek a deep and living experience in the things of God. We have not a moment to lose. Events of vital importance are taking place around us; we are on Satan‚Äôs enchanted ground. Sleep not, sentinels of God; the foe is lurking near, ready at any moment, should you become lax and drowsy, to spring upon you and make you his prey.‚Äù The Call to Stand Apart, p. 69</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe has shown you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?‚Äù Micah. 6:8</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p> 
<p>When you are facing a challenging decision, where do you turn for wisdom and counsel? Of course, we are told that in a multitude of counselors there is safety (see Prov. 11:14). But beyond the wisdom of our loved ones or those we respect, what principles do we find in God‚Äôs Word for how to make decisions?
(See Prov. 3:5,6, Prov. 14:12, Matt. 6:33, Jer. 33:3)</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong> </p>
<p>The South American Division presented, as it has for the past 50 years, a special ‚ÄúHoly Week‚Äù evangelism outreach program across the division this past week. Usually, small groups meet in homes and churches, but due to the Coronavirus, the division offered the full program online with many more in attendance. The theme was ‚ÄúLove Written with Blood,‚Äù and featured special programming for children, teens, and adults. We praise the Lord for the creative ways that church leaders are helping share the love of God.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢Pray that those who discovered Jesus‚Äô love for the first time, in these South American Division programs, would be able to develop a lasting relationship with Jesus that will only grow more beautiful with time.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray that we all would use the extra time we have at home to study deeply in God‚Äôs Word and teach our children how to study and love God‚Äôs Word.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray that God‚Äôs people would continue to be faithful with their tithes and offerings even in the midst of current economic challenges.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray for those who are struggling to pay bills and keep food on the table due to the economic challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought. Pray that God would continue to provide for His children and that there would be many testimonies of God‚Äôs faithfulness to share in the coming days.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray for the church work in Lebanon that God would provide for their financial needs and help the mission of the church go forward.</p>

<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 25 - April 20</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Rejoicing in the Word </strong></p>
	
<p>‚ÄúThere is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God‚Äôs word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose that is rarely seen in these times.‚Äù Christian Education, p. 58</p>

<p>‚ÄúYour words were found, and I ate them, and Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; For I am called by Your name, O LORD God of hosts.‚Äù Jer. 15:16</p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>What is something that has been especially meaningful or brought joy to you in your study of the Word recently? Why don‚Äôt you take some time to share that joy with someone today.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong> </p>
<p>New York City was expected to be way overcrowded in hospitals with no beds and not enough ventilators. But, while they have been very full, they still have some space left in hospitals, and we praise the Lord that they have not run out of ventilators. This is an answer to prayer.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who work security positions, like police officers, and others. As civil unrest grows due to the lockdown in certain parts of the world, pray for protection for these men and woman.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the former Soviet Union Euro-Asia Division territories, which include countries like Russia and Siberia. Pray that despite the difficultly in witnessing, that new effective methods of reaching the people will be developed.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the hurting countries throughout the 10/40 window. Pray that God would provide people to share His love. Pray also that governments would allow the people to get food or work in their fields to grow food. Millions across India have been in lockdown and not allowed out of their houses, which means many are starving.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for wisdom for church leaders as they need to make significant decisions for the future as a result of the economic crisis we are currently facing.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for wisdom in how to cut expenses while not hurting people and still keeping the essential work and mission of the church moving forward.</p>

<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 24 - April 19</p>
<p>üìú <strong>In Awe of His Word </strong></p>
	
<p>Have you ever read a verse in the Bible and thought to yourself, ‚ÄúThat was just for me! How did God know what I needed today?‚Äù As you go about your day today, think of all the reasons why you can rejoice because of God‚Äôs Word. In fact, why don‚Äôt you write down a list of reasons you are thankful for God‚Äôs Word. Start it with, ‚ÄúI love God‚Äôs Word because it‚Ä¶ (and fill in the blank).‚Äù If you struggle thinking of things, read Psalm 119.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPrinces persecute me without a cause, But my heart stands in awe of Your word. I rejoice at Your word as one who finds great treasure.‚Äù Psalms. 119:161-162</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Bible is God‚Äôs voice speaking to us, just as surely as if we could hear it with our ears. If we realized this, with what awe we would open God‚Äôs Word and with what earnestness we would search its precepts. The reading and contemplation of the Scriptures would be regarded as an audience with the Infinite One.‚Äù A Call to Stand Apart, p. 69</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p> 
	
<p>We praise the Lord that the Adventist church in Guatemala has found a way to distribute food baskets with rice, beans, cornmeal, oil, salt, and sugar to thousands of its church members who are being affected by this quarantine. This is evidence of church members seeking to share each other‚Äôs burdens.</p>

<p></strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Africa as they are fighting the Coronavirus pandemic. Pray for our church members who are struggling because of lack of adequate health care. Pray that the rates of infection and death will not be as projected.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the thousands of ethnic groups around the world, that make up 69% of earth‚Äôs population, that have not yet had a clear presentation of Jesus. Pray for new innovative ways to reach them during this crisis.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a spirit of repentance and humility for all of us regarding the times we have not been personally faithful to God in our life and witness.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a mighty increase in church members who will serve God by loving others and actively sharing Bible truth with others, including those from other religious backgrounds.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for farmers who are struggling to plant or harvest crops without the usual support workers, who have been banned from traveling.</p>

<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 23 - April 18</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Sustained by the Word</strong></p>
	
<p>What ways do you feel God growing and proving your faith? What are some of your favorite Bible promises you like to claim when you are struggling? As a heart challenge this week, why don‚Äôt you find a new Bible verse that gives you courage and memorize it. Then share it with someone who is in need of courage.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCast your burden on the LORD, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.‚Äù Psalms 55:22</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy fellow-laborers, let not your courage fail. God is proving your faith. The Christian always has a strong helper in the Lord. When you come to a pause in your earnest efforts because you are unable to obtain the needed help, cast your burden upon the Lord. Be content to leave it there, certain that He is faithful who has promised. The What and How of the Lord‚Äôs helping we know not; but this we do know, the Lord will never fail those who put their trust in Him. When He has fully proved His workers, He will bring them forth refined as gold tried in the fire.‚Äù Ellen White, Letter 66, June 26, 1901, par. 29</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong> </p>
<p>We praise the Lord that the early projections for massive death rate in the United States as a result of COVID-19 are being lowered quite dramatically. The pandemic is also continuing to slow down throughout Europe, and there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the health professionals on the front lines who are continuing to battle this epidemic. Pray for their health safety from COVID-19, and their physical safety from irrational people on the streets who think medical personnel are contaminated.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that there would be a balance between locking down the whole world at home and opening up the economy and activities at the right time‚Äîas soon as safe so that the economy and businesses are not completely destroyed.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the many organizations, and small businesses who are suffering financially as a result of the lockdown. Pray that people would find ways to help support small businesses so they don‚Äôt go under.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for women and children who are in dangerous situations and need protection. Pray for ways to reach out to the vulnerable and weak in your own community.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who work in banks, grocery stores, gas stations, and other essential businesses. Pray that they would be protected from getting the Coronavirus as they deal with many people coming for services.</p>

<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 22 - April 17</p>
<p>üìú <strong> Come, Rest Awhile </strong></p>
			
<p>What is the greatest barrier that stops you from spending quality time with God? Are there blocks you could ask God to help you remove to clear away certain distractions? How might this change your prayer and Bible study habits?</p>

<p>‚ÄúThose who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude‚Ä¶ Our lives may seem a tangle; but as we commit ourselves to the wise Master Worker, He will bring out the pattern of life and character
that will be to His own glory.‚Äù (Desire of Ages, p. 331)</p>

<p><strong>ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE:</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps God is wanting to work through the difficult circumstances around us to help us realize our great need for Him before He returns. He is providing a unique opportunity for us to rest awhile in Him. Will you respond to His invitation? Let‚Äôs claim the promises of John 15:4, 5; Isa. 26:2, 3 and Mark 6:33 while we seek rest and assurance in Him.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT!</strong></p>
<p>In spite of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the Seventh-day Adventist Church continues to move forward in mission. And many creative and new methods of sharing the gospel are being developed with a much broader reach then we‚Äôve yet experienced. Praise the Lord!</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus:</strong> </p>
<p>1.Pray for our church members and those who are grieving the recent loss of loved ones due to COVID-19. Pray for peace and comfort for their hearts. Pray for physical healing for those who are currently battling the Coronavirus.</p>

<p>2. Pray that church members will actively embrace the healthy lifestyle principles of NEWSTART (which stand for Nutrition, Exercise, Water, Sunshine, Temperance, Air, Rest, and Trust in God) as a balanced approach to healthy living.</p>

<p>3. Pray that we as a church will continue to will find ways to effectively share God‚Äôs health message, along with the Three Angels‚Äô messages, which is our last-day mission to the world including our need to plead for the latter rain of the Holy Spirit, as we prepare for Christ's soon second coming.</p>

<p>4. Pray that in our eagerness to find creative ways to witness to others, we don‚Äôt lose our strong emphasis on Christ, His Word, His righteousness, His sanctuary service, and His saving power in the great controversy.</p>

<p>5. Pray for the It Is Written online evangelistic campaign ‚ÄúHope Awakens‚Äù that is launching today nationwide. (To learn more visit: https://www.discoverhopeawakens.com/). Pray that even more people will be able to watch and gain interest in this series than they would have with the LIVE evangelistic event that was cancelled in Indianapolis.</p>

<p><strong>Motivational - "Come, Rest Awhile"</strong></p>
<p>by Nina Atcheson</p>

<p>One beautiful morning, I realized the house was too quiet, and my three-year old daughter was missing. Her brothers were playing together, but she was nowhere to be found. I called out for her, wondering where she could be. ‚ÄúTahlia, where are you?‚Äù My voice echoed through the house, but silence responded. I walked through different rooms, finding no trace of her.</p>

<p>Finally, I heard a tiny voice. ‚ÄúMummy...‚Äù Her little head poked out from behind my red chair. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù she held up our worship book, the page open to a picture of Jesus and His angels descending to earth. ‚ÄúHe comes today, Mummy?‚Äù she asked, pointing to the window beside her.</p>

<p>My heart melted as I realized that she was sitting there, waiting for Jesus to come back today. In my morning rush, I was making breakfast, hanging out washing, and answering the phone instead. The immediacy of these ‚Äòurgent‚Äô chores had completely distracted me from giving any time to Jesus that morning. God couldn‚Äôt have spoken more clearly than through Tahlia at that moment. It was like He was saying, Just slow down and notice Me this morning. I‚Äôm here. And I‚Äôm coming soon! Spend some time with Me‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Today, many years later, I still hear God‚Äôs words to me. ‚ÄúCome aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while‚Äù (Mark 6:31). He invites us to stop, in the maddening rush around us, to be with Him. Not just momentarily or out of obligation, but for a season, because we want to spend time with the Restorer of Our Souls.</p>

<p>Right now, many of us find ourselves in a place where we are isolated in our homes due to a global pandemic. In a sense, we have been forced to pause in our usual rush of life. Our lives have changed for this season. Are we resting in Him in this ‚Äúdeserted place‚Äù? Are we listening to His still small voice (1 Kings 19:12), calling us into a closer walk with Him (John 15:9)? Are we coming aside to know Him more, or are we filling up the quiet space with the noise of other distractions?</p>

<p>As a child, I remember singing a song that included these words: ‚ÄúTime with Him is time well spent. He will be your Comfort and your Guide. Time with Him is time well spent. He will always be right by your side.‚Äù Building our relationship with God by spending time with our Comforter and Guide, is of utmost importance in the times we find ourselves in right now. Quality time (instead of quantity or length of time) is what counts most. What might you do to improve the quality of your time with God this week? Consider the following ideas:</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Ask God to give you a greater desire to spend time with Him.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ The Bible is not meant to be difficult to study. It‚Äôs God‚Äôs living Word to you, and He is waiting to speak to you through it.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Come in humility and pray before you read your Bible, asking God for a specific message that you need to hear.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ You may want to take just one verse or one small bite-size portion of Scripture each day. Consider: What is God telling me through this passage? How can I encourage someone today with this message?</p>
<p>God waits patiently for us to spend time with Him every day (Rev. 3:20). Will you wait expectantly, like Tahlia, longing for His return? Will you come and rest awhile with Him as you wait?</p>

<p>Nina Atcheson currently serves as the Curriculum Manager for the Sabbath School and Personal Ministries Department at the General Conference, and the Adventist Identity Officer for Adventist Schools Australia. Nina, her husband Matt, and their three children live near the Gold Coast, Australia.</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 21 - April 16</p>
<p>üìú <strong>Let's Talk Faith</strong></p>
			
<p>What does it mean to talk and act in faith? If our faith is weak, how do we grow stronger faith? (See Romans 10:17). Share with someone today an experience where God grew your faith, or tell someone a testimony about an answered prayer.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God.‚Äù Ps. 20:6-7</p>

<p>‚ÄúTake the word of Christ as your assurance. Has He not invited you to come unto Him? Never allow yourself to talk in a hopeless, discouraged way. If you do you will lose much. By looking at appearances and complaining when difficulties and pressure come, you give evidence of a sickly, enfeebled faith. Talk and act as if your faith was invincible. The Lord is rich in resources; He owns the world. Look heavenward in faith. Look to Him who has light and power and efficiency.‚Äù Christ Object Lessons, p. 146</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>We praise the Lord for the health message that He has given us, that enables us to be stronger to fight off sickness and disease. We praise the Lord for the many ways that He‚Äôs enabling us to share this health message with others.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus:</strong></p>
<p>1. Pray that God would continue to help us become a people of strong faith, for we know much more difficult trials lie ahead.</p>

<p>2. Pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon God‚Äôs people so that the work can be finished and we can go home.</p>

<p>3. Pray for wisdom for pastors and administrators as they seek to comfort and encourage and lead in the midst of chaos.</p>

<p>4. Pray that we as a people would do our best to live the health principles we‚Äôve been taught that our body can have strong immune systems.</p>

<p>5. Pray that God‚Äôs love would so fill us, so move us, so break our hearts afresh, that we could not contain it, but would share it with those who have no hope.	</p>

<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 20 - April 15</p>
<p>üìú <strong>God is Faithful</strong></p>

<p>Do you feel like you are dealing with more than you can bear? God promises He won‚Äôt give us more than we can bear, so if you feel overwhelmed claim the promise of 1 Cor. 10:13. Claim the promise of Phil. 4:13, and Ps. 61:2. Comfort yourself today in the promises
of God‚Äôs Word.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.‚Äù 1 Cor. 10:13</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe enemy dare not go one hairbreadth beyond his appointed sphere. There is no power in the whole satanic force that can disable the soul that trusts, in simple confidence, in the wisdom that comes from God. Christ is our tower of strength, and Satan can have no power over the soul that walks with God in humility of mind. The promise, ‚ÄúLet him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.‚Äù In Christ there is perfect and complete help for every tempted soul. Dangers beset every path, but the whole universe of heaven is standing on guard, that none may be tempted above that which he is able to bear.‚Äù My Life Today, p. 316</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>Across Europe (and probably many places around the world), young people that haven‚Äôt been going to church are getting active in online Bible study groups. We praise the Lord for this increased interest in God and His Word!</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus:</strong></p>
<p>1. Pray that even more of our youth would be interested in learning to study their Bibles. Pray that there would be a great revival among our youth.</p>

<p>2. Pray for our youth around the world, who are participating in their own 100 Days of Prayer led out by the General Conference Youth Department and Children Ministries department. Pray that our youth and young people would learn that when we pray God hears and answers prayer.</p>

<p>3. Pray for teachers as they struggle to teach classes online. Pray that God would give them wisdom how to utilize technology in away that is beneficial for all. Pray for wisdom and patience.</p>

<p>4. Pray for those that are broken, for those that have recently lost loved ones, and for those struggling in isolation to feel that God is still near.</p>

<p>5. Pray for endurance for doctors, nurses, and health professionals that are on the front lines battling the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 19 - April 14</p>
<p>üìú Topic: <strong>LOOK UP TO JESUS</strong></p>
<p>üí° <strong>Study Verse:</strong> ‚ÄúMy voice You shall hear in the morning, O LORD; In the morning I will direct it to You, And I will look up.‚Äù<strong>(Ps. 5:3)</strong></p>

<p>üîñ <strong>Read:</strong> ‚ÄúSummon all your powers to look up, not down at your difficulties; then you will never faint by the way. You will soon see Jesus behind the cloud, reaching out His hand to help you; and all you have to do is to give Him your hand in simple faith and let Him lead you. As you become trustful you will, through faith in Jesus, become hopeful. The light shining from the cross of Calvary will reveal to you God‚Äôs estimate of the soul, and, appreciating that estimate, you will seek to reflect the light to the world. A great name among men is as letters traced in sand, but a spotless character will endure to all eternity.‚Äù <strong>(Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 578)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Heart Questions:</strong></p>
<p>What is the first thing that you do each morning? Do you look at the news, your e-mails or social media? Do you start thinking about all your problems? Or do you look up to Jesus? As you go through today, make a new commitment to look to Jesus instead of looking down on your trials. Look to Jesus for hope instead of turning to the secular world for encouragement.</p>

<p><strong>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</strong></p>

<p><strong>Prayer Focus (Day 19)</strong></p>

<p><strong>FIRST A PRAISE REPORT:</strong> </p>
<p>In the last thirty days, over a hundred thousand resources have been downloaded from www.revivalandreformation.org. We praise the Lord that many people are recognizing their spiritual need and seeking to grow in their walk with God. We also praise the Lord that thousands of prayer groups are starting all around the world as a result of this COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members throughout Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Belgium. These hot spot areas are still struggling to curtail the virus. Pray for healing for those who have experienced loss.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members throughout the Middle East, especially in Iran and Israel. Pray for those that are living cramped up in tiny compartments with little fresh air and no ability to get exercise.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for your neighbors who may not know Jesus. Pray for ways to share the hope of Jesus with them, maybe through ‚Äúcell phone‚Äù evangelism or other helpful online resources. </p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for those in your own church or community who are fighting COVID-19 right now. Pray for God‚Äôs healing hand to be upon them.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that we would all be faithful stewards and return our tithe. Even though times are difficult the Bible tells us that those who honor God, He will honor <strong>(1 Sam. 2:30)</strong>.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 18 - April 13</p>
<p>üìú Looking Beyond what is Seen</p>

<p>‚ÄúJesus said to him, ‚ÄòThomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.‚Äô ‚Äù John 20:29

‚ÄúOften the Christian life is beset with dangers, and duty seems hard to perform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before, and bondage and death behind. Yet the voice of God speaks clearly, Go forward. Let us obey the command, even though our sight cannot penetrate the darkness.

The obstacles that hinder our progress will never disappear before a halting, doubting spirit. Those who defer obedience till every uncertainty disappears, and there remains no risk of failure or defeat, will never obey. Faith looks beyond the difficulties, and lays hold of the unseen, even Omnipotence, therefore it cannot be baffled. Faith is the clasping of the hand of Christ in every emergency.‚Äù Gospel Workers, p. 262

Heart Questions.
It is easy to believe what we see, but what about the things we cannot see? What are ways that we can grow our faith in God‚Äôs Word, even though we have not yet seen its fulfillment? We are told Faith is a gift. Based on Ephesians 2:8 and Acts 3:16,
where do we get this amazing gift?


PRAISE REPORT: 
In Papua New Guinea outside evangelists, pastors, and lay preachers can no longer travel into the country, due to COVID-19 travel bans, for the previously scheduled Total Member Involvement event that was suppose to take place this May. However, the local people in Papua New Guinea had already been rallying together this past year holding tens of thousands of Bible studies, and initiating thousands of local meetings held by lay people and pastors. And they are already making plans for another big evangelistic thrust to follow after the current COVID-19 pandemic has passed. Again, what the enemy has meant for evil, God is turning to even greater good.

Prayer Focus
1. Pray for God's protection over the people and country of Papua New Guinea and also for God's leading in decision making for the PNG Government and its health professionals as they battle COVID-19.

2. Pray that what God does in Papua New Guinea through the local church members would be even more successful than the original plans that were made. Pray that there will be no tribal fighting as plans are made to move forward.

3. Pray for believers who are incarcerated in different prisons around the world. Pray for strength to witness to fellow inmates during this crisis.

4. Pray for a small bakery and mission center in J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden to reach even more people, so that many will come know Jesus and accept Him as their Savior. Pray for more Bible study contacts and conversions.

5. Pray also for the local churches throughout Sweden, which are small and composed of mostly elderly people. Pray that God would bring more young people into the churches in Scandinavia, and that He would protect these small congregations during this COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

   <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 17 - April 12</p>
<p>‚ÄúCall upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.‚Äù Ps. 50:15</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe greatest victories gained for the cause of God are not the result of labored argument, ample facilities, wide influence, or abundance of means; they are gained in the audience chamber with God, when with earnest, agonizing faith men lay hold upon the
mighty arm of power.‚Äù Gospel Workers, p. 259</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Since we know that we gain our greatest victories through prayer and time in God‚Äôs Word, why are we so hesitant to take the time to pray and study the Bible? What activities or distractions are getting in the way of your personal communion with God?</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>
<p>1 PRAISE REPORT: In the Queensland city of Toowoomba (population 130,000), there are two churches, Toowoomba Central and Glenvale. Pastor Casey Wolverton is the pastor of the Glenvale Church. When the COVID19 virus hit and churches were closed, on the first Sabbath, they conducted the worship service as normal but with no one in the pews and broadcast it on Facebook or Youtube and 900 people viewed the service. The local radio station heard what the Adventists were doing, so the radio station approached the Adventist Church asking if they could record the Adventist service and broadcast it the next day (Sunday) to an audience of 130,000 people. Without the COVID-19 crisis it is very unlikely that this would have happened. Praise God!</p>

<p>2. Pray that special messages of hope can continue to be broadcasted throughout the city of Toowoomba in Queensland Australia. Pray for church members throughout Australia, that they can find ways to continue to be a light to those around them.</p>

<p>3. Pray for our many Literature Evangelists around the world that can no longer go door to door. Pray for God to open up new ways for these dedicated workers to share the truth. And pray that God would provide for their needs.</p>

<p>4. Pray for hospitals across the United States who are expecting to have their most difficult week yet in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Pray for God to intervene.</p>

<p>5. Pray for the elderly, the immune-compromised, and other high-risk members in your local church. Pray that God‚Äôs protecting hand would be around them.</p>

<p>6. Pray for those who have already lost loved ones because of this Coronavirus outbreak. Pray for courage and strength for those experiencing loss to hold on to God.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 16 - April 11</p>
  <p>‚ÄúCall to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.‚Äù Jeremiah. 33:3</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe have come to serious times. Events in our world call upon every follower of Christ to be totally in earnest in our relationship with God. To strengthen this relationship and satisfy our emotional and spiritual needs, we must learn the power of prayer. We must plead with the Lord, like the disciples of old, saying, ‚ÄòLord, teach us to pray.‚Äô ‚Äù Prayer, p. 1</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>We may be part of 100 Days of Prayer, and we may be praying with our small prayer groups, but have we really learned what it means to pray? Have we ever earnestly cried out like the disciples cried to Jesus, ‚ÄúLord, teach us to pray?‚Äù If you haven‚Äôt done this, why don‚Äôt you ask the Lord today, ‚ÄúPlease teach me to pray!‚Äù</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>
<p>1. PRAISE REPORT: Although Indianapolis had to cancel the large evangelistic meetings planned pre-GC session, now John Bradshaw is planning to do a series of meetings online which we believe will have much greater reach. We expect tens of thousands of people to attend. Once again, what the enemy has meant for evil, God is turning around for good.</p>

<p>2. Pray that we as a church would ask God to send the Holy Spirit and teach us how to pray in a way that we will receive answers.</p>

<p>3. Pray for the online evangelistic series that John Bradshaw and It is Written is planning. Pray that many people will tune in and that many will make decisions for Jesus.</p>

<p>4. Pray for medical professionals and hospitals in your area that are struggling with a shortage of medically supplies. Pray that God would provide what is needed so our health professionals can stay safe.</p>

<p>5. Pray that more people will make masks and other protective equipment, and that the needed beds, ventilators, and health facilities would be opened to accommodate the surge in medical care needed.</p>

<p>6. Pray for the Chinese ministry in Cebu City in the Philippines. Pray for protection from the Coronavirus for the church there and that more Chinese people will take an active interest in the study of the Scriptures.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>‚ÄúHow can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your word. With my whole heart I have sought You; Oh, let me not wander from Your commandments! Your word I have hidden in my heart, That I might not sin against You.‚Äù Ps. 119:9-11</p>

<p>*HEART QUESTIONS*: While we know that it is always God‚Äôs will to heal His children, we don‚Äôt always know His will regarding timing. Some He might choose to heal immediately, others gradually, while others He may not heal until the second coming (James 5). Can we trust God and His timing? Can we hold on in faith even when we don‚Äôt always see immediate answers to our prayers? How can we grow our faith and trust in God and His Word?</p>

<p>*ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE*: This week, as we continue to pray for the sick, for the medical professionals, and for God to stop the spread of the Coronavirus around the world, let‚Äôs pray that a love for God and His Word would spread. Let‚Äôs open our Bibles with new enthusiasm and pray, ‚ÄúLord, show us how to know You and love You! Show us how to experience true healing from the inside out. Show us what it means to study and understand Your Word. And show us how to share Your Word with others.‚Äù As we pray, let‚Äôs claim Isa. 55:8-11, 2 Tim. 2:15, and 1 Pet. 3:15.</p>

<p>‚Äì Prayer Focus ‚Äì</p>

<p>PRAISE REPORT! It appears that the spread of the pandemic is starting to slow down a little in Spain and Italy. We praise God that there is hope for improvement.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that God would stop the spread of COVID19 in the countries of the world with high concentrated populations. Pray especially for the Lord‚Äôs intervention in India, Bangladesh, the continent of Africa, and some countries throughout Asia that are just beginning to battle the COVID-19 pandemic in full force.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for medical researchers to find treatments that cure the Coronavirus as we don‚Äôt have months to wait for the development of a vaccine.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God‚Äôs protection for children, for the weak, and vulnerable, who are forced to stay home with abusive family members or who live in difficult foster homes.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for provision for food and meals for children that can no longer attend school where food was regularly provided.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray that we would learn to study God‚Äôs Word on a deeper level, and also share His Word in practical ways with those around us.</p>

<p>Motivational - *An Unexpected Miracle*</p>

<p>By James L. Black, Sr.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave you ever seen anything like this?‚Äù This becomes a common question when people witness something they have never seen before. No doubt the name ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù will go down in history as one of the world‚Äôs greatest pandemics.</p>

<p>It is amazing how quickly life can change overnight. The word of God reminds us that disasters will come, and we should always be prepared and dependent upon the Lord. This world crisis has ripped the core out of the economy; overwhelmed medical systems; left many in greater poverty; left many homeless and jobless; left many with permanent illnesses; and yes, it has claimed the lives of tens of thousands.</p>

<p>Many are praying for a miracle. Many are pleading with God to change their situation and protect them from the deadly virus. But the question is, are we prepared for the kind of miracles God performs?</p>

<p>I have no doubt that God will hear and come through for everyone who prays to Him. While He comes through in different ways and in His own time, these promises give me hope. ‚ÄúNo man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you‚Äù (Joshua 1:5), and ‚ÄúIt shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear‚Äù (Isaiah 65:24).</p>

<p>Several years ago, I developed a bone marrow disease called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a depletion of the body‚Äôs red blood cells. If left untreated, MDS leads to Acute leukemia or death. I was at stage 4 of the disease, and my only hope was a successful bone marrow (stem cell) transplant. Thousands around the world were praying for my survival and recovery at a time when I was too weak to sincerely pray for myself. Yes, I can testify that God came through for me, but not in the expected way, for God‚Äôs miracles are about eternal life.</p>

<p>Three things happened that revealed the Lord to me in ways I had not experienced before. First, due to circumstances beyond my control, my transplant process was delayed for nine months even though I was at stage 4 of the disease. This delay provided the opportunity for aggressive wholistic, natural treatments that strengthened my body and better prepared me for the transplant. Second, my daughter (my stem cell donor) and I were able to bond prior to the transplant, leading to an incredible moment of forgiveness. The third was what it did for me and my wife. For the first time in our marriage, I was on my back in the hospital, with a life threatening disease, in isolation, and with chronic fatigue. I was too weak to bathe, so on three or four occasions my wife Maxine had to bathe me. At first I was angry, but when I saw her gentleness and total commitment as she showered me from head to toe, I realized that God was preparing me for a special miracle of healing.</p>

<p>My special miracle is found in these words of Jesus: ‚ÄúWhen Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, ‚ÄòSon, your sins are forgiven you.‚Äô‚Äù Yes, the miracle in my greatest time of need was that God healed me before the transplant. By the grace of God, I walked out of the hospital a new creature in Jesus and healed of a spiritual and physical disease.</p>

<p>Today, I encourage you to take your eyes off of COVID-19 and anything else that may be distracting you, and like the four friends who brought the paralytic to Jesus, tear off the roof, come before Jesus and let Him heal your soul.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear‚Äù (Isaiah 65:24).</p>

<p>Pastor James L. Black, Sr. most recently served 17 years in the North American Division as the youth/young adult ministries director. He is currently director for the North American Division Prayer Ministries.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 14 - April 9</p>
<p>üìú Purified through the Fire</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.‚Äù Rom. 8:18</p>

<p>‚ÄúThrough trial and persecution the glory‚Äîthe character‚Äîof God is revealed in His chosen ones. The believers in Christ, hated and persecuted by the world, are educated and disciplined in the school of Christ. On earth they walk in narrow paths; they are purified in the furnace of affliction. They follow Christ through sore conflicts; they endure self-denial and experience bitter disappointments; but thus they learn the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with abhorrence. Being partakers of Christ‚Äôs sufferings, they can look beyond the gloom to the glory, saying, ‚ÄòI reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.‚Äô Romans 8:18.‚Äù Acts of the Apostles, p. 576</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What is the glory that Romans 8:18 speaks of? Why are trials and suffering helpful to purify us? What have you learned about yourself through the trials of the recent weeks? Do you recognize weak spots in your character that you didn‚Äôt realize you had? How are you praying that God would grow you during this difficult time?</p>

<p>Day 14 - Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1. Pray for heavenly vision that we can see beyond the grave, beyond the pain and suffering and hardship of this life, to see the heavenly reward that awaits those that are faithful to the end.</p>

<p>2. Pray for wisdom for pastors and administrators as they seek to comfort and encourage and lead in the midst of chaos.</p>

<p>3. Pray for our children that are out of school, and especially for those who relied on the meals that they received at school. Pray that God would raise up caring Christians to find ways to feed them during this time of crisis.</p>

<p>4. Pray that God‚Äôs love would so fill us, so move us, so break our hearts afresh, that we could not contain it, but would share it with those who have no hope.</p>

<p>5. Pray that we will understand and actively share the message of ‚ÄúRighteousness by Faith‚Äù and that we will rest in the righteousness of Jesus.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 13 - April 8</p>
<p>üìú OUR EYES ARE UPON YOU!</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúO our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.‚Äù(2 Chron. 20:12)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúGod would not have us remain pressed down by dumb sorrow, with sore and breaking hearts. He would have us look up and behold His dear face of love. The blessed Saviour stands by many whose eyes are so blinded by tears that they do not discern Him. He longs to clasp our hands, to have us look to Him in simple faith, permitting Him to guide us. His heart is open to our griefs, our sorrows, and our trials. He has loved us with an everlasting love and with loving-kindness compassed us about‚Ä¶Think of this, children of suffering and sorrow, and rejoice in hope. ‚ÄòThis is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.‚Äô (1 John 5:4).‚Äù Thoughts from the Mount of Blessings, p. 12</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What does it mean to keep our eyes on Jesus? What happens sometimes when our eyes are blinded by tears? What is God longing to do? Just as God‚Äôs heart is open to our sorrows and grief, so our heart should be open to the sorrow and grief of others. How can we extend His arm of compassion and tender sympathy to those around us today?</p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for those that are broken, for those that have recently lost loved ones, and for those struggling to feel that God is still near. </p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members facing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic across the country of Canada. Pray for strength and peace, and healing. Pray for spiritual revival and that the gospel will advance throughout Canada as a result of these challenging times. </p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for selfless love and giving to be the life of church members worldwide. Pray that those who have more resources would reach out and share with those who have less.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that church members worldwide would put away their differences and come close in Christian fellowship, pleading for the Latter Rain.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that church members worldwide would take personal responsibility for sharing the gospel with those around them even in the wake of large evangelistic events being canceled.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 12 - April 7</p>
<p>üìú Topic: GOD'S COVENANT WITH US</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúIf My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.‚Äù(2 Chron. 7:14)</p>

<p>üîñRead: ‚ÄúThe members of our churches need to be converted, to become more spiritual-minded. A chain of earnest, praying believers should encircle the world. Let all pray in humility. A few neighbors may meet together to pray for the Holy Spirit. Let those who cannot leave home, gather in their children, and unite in learning to pray together. They may claim the promise of the Saviour: ‚ÄòWhere two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.‚Äô ‚Äù Review and Herald, January 3, 1907, par. 4</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Based on 2 Chronicles 7:14 we see that God is looking for a heart of humility and repentance. Why is a spirit of humility so important when we pray? Why is united prayer important? How can we experience united prayer even while apart? </p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus (Day 12)</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that we would know as a church what it means to walk in humility before God and before each other. Pray that He would teach us how to pray, how to repent, and that healing would come as we seek God with all our hearts.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Pray that God would help us as a people know what it means to be more spiritually minded, and how to create a chain of prayer around the world.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for church members living in the South England Conference in London. Pray that rather than this pandemic discouraging church members, there would be church growth, increased commitment to God and service.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Pray for our youth across Europe, to come back to church, and for parents to be strong positive role models by bringing their children to church. </p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 11 - April 6</p>
<p> üìú Topic: GOD'S RAINBOW OF ASSURANCE</p>
<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.‚Äù(Matt. 7:7-8)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúThe rainbow round about the throne is an assurance that God is true, that in Him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. We have sinned against Him, and are undeserving of His favor; yet He Himself has put into our lips that most wonderful of pleas, ‚ÄòDo not abhor us, for Thy name‚Äôs sake; do not disgrace the throne of Thy glory; remember, break not Thy covenant with us.‚Äô Jeremiah 14:21. When we come to Him confessing our unworthiness and sin, He has pledged Himself to give heed to our cry. The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His Word unto us.‚Äù Christ Object Lessons, p. 148 </p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Reflect on the three different types of prayer as seen in Matthew 7:7-8. What is the significance of the rainbow around God‚Äôs throne? What is God‚Äôs pledge to us? What is staked against the honor of His throne? How does this give you confidence today?</p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 10 - April 5</p>
<p>üìú Topic: HIDDEN IN HIS TABERNACLE</p>

<p>üí° Study Verse: ‚ÄúFor in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.‚Äù_ (Psalms 27:5)</p>

<p>üîñ Read: ‚ÄúGod will do great things for those who trust in Him. The reason why His professed people have no greater strength is that they trust so much to their own wisdom, and do not give the Lord an opportunity to reveal His power in their behalf. He will help His believing children in every emergency if they will place their entire confidence in Him and faithfully obey Him.‚Äù _Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 493_</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What does it mean to be hidden in the secret of His tabernacle? Why do we as Christians have so little spiritual strength? What are two actions that God is waiting to see in us? How can we practice these two actions right now during our present crisis?</p>

  <p>Day Seven</p>
  <p>What type of faith do we need to have? And how are our greatest victories gained? Share with a loved one some 
  victories you have gained recently, or some victories that you need to gain. Pray for one another personally! </p>

  <p>‚ÄúCall upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you and you shall glorify Me.‚Äù Ps. 50:15</p>

<p>‚ÄúJacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His experience testifies to the power of 
importunate prayer. It is now that we are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of unyielding faith. 
The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual Christian are not those that are gained by 
talent or education, by wealth or the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience 
chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power.‚Äù 
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 203</p>

  <p>Day Six</p>
  <p>We are all in a very serious battle. Doctors and nurses and medical professionals on the front line are especially 
  feeling the heat of this battle. How can we encourage them in their work? How are we to fight our battles? And what 
  is the holy calling that the church must awake to in the spiritual realm? </p>

<p>‚ÄúAs for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD shall save me. Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry 
   aloud, and He shall hear my voice. He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there 
   were many against me.‚Äù Ps. 55:16-18 </p>
 
<p>‚ÄúWhen the church awakes to the sense of her holy calling, many more fervent and effective prayers will ascend to
   heaven for the Holy Spirit to point out the
