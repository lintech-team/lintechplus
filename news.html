  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Six</p>
  <p>We are all in a very serious battle. Doctors and nurses and medical professionals on the front line are especially 
  feeling the heat of this battle. How can we encourage them in their work? How are we to fight our battles? And what 
  is the holy calling that the church must awake to in the spiritual realm? </p>

<p>‚ÄúAs for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD shall save me. Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry 
   aloud, and He shall hear my voice. He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there 
   were many against me.‚Äù Ps. 55:16-18 </p>
 
<p>‚ÄúWhen the church awakes to the sense of her holy calling, many more fervent and effective prayers will ascend to
   heaven for the Holy Spirit to point out the work and duty of God‚Äôs people regarding the salvation of souls. We 
  have a standing promise that God will draw near to every seeking soul.‚Äù 1 Selected Messages, p. 116 </p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Five</p>
  <p>We are told that the Holy Spirit will be given when we ask. We are also told that Heaven is waiting to give us 
this gift corporately as a church. So, what is heaven waiting for? Is heaven waiting for you and me? Could it be that
 we don't truly recognize our great spiritual need? Could it be that we've been content with a little of the Holy Spirit when 
God is longing to give us a full outpouring? </p>


<p>‚ÄúIf you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father 
give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!‚Äù Luke 11:13 </p>

<p>‚ÄúThe descent of the Holy Spirit upon the church is looked forward to as in the future; but it is the privilege of 
the church to have it now. Seek for it, pray for it, believe for it. We must have it, and Heaven is waiting to bestow it.‚Äù 
The Review and Herald, March 19, 1895</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Four</p>
  <p>What are some practical ways that we can combat fear? What about claiming Bible promises, singing songs, and 
reflecting on God's leading in our past? Share with someone a time when God carried you through a difficult trial and 
how your faith grew through that experience. As we reflect on His leading in the past, we will have renewed confidence 
for the future.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFaith grows strong by coming into conflict with doubts and opposing influences. The experience gained in these trials is of more value than the most costly jewels.‚Äù Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 555</p>

  <p>"He (Christ) was nailed to the cross. The crowd, in whose hearts humanity seemed 
to be dead, sought to aggravate the cruel sufferings of the Son of God by 
their revilings. But as a sheep before 
His shearers is dumb, so He opened not 
His mouth. He was giving His life for the life of the world, that all who 
believed in Him should not perish.... Amidst this outbreak take heart and be
 of good courage for we know who holds our lives in His 
mighty hands. üôèüèæ" #NewlifeDailyHope</p>

  <h1>Stewardship Week of Prayer</h1>
    <p>You are welcome to this revival week. Summary of stewardship revival week message, God First, with sis Grace Otieno Day One</p>
     <p> 1. Irrefutable principles of stewardship:</p>
      <p>i) Ownership- God;</p>
      <p>ii) Responsibility- given to man;</p>
      <p>iii) Accountability - expected of man</p>
      <p>iv) Reward- by God to man.</p>
      <p>2. Areas to put God First: time; temple (body); talent and treasure.</p>
      <p>3. Good management of time, temple, applying talent gives treasure out of which tithe is returned to God and in appreciation of abundance, offering is given.</p>
      <p>4. God is first, its man who fails to recognise and acknowledge this. As a result, he/ she fears and worries about:</p>
      <p>i) basic needs;</p>
      <p>ii) personal worth/ value;</p>
      <p>iii) things beyond his/her control.</p>
      <p>5. Purpose to put God First in all spheres of life, He is mightily able; He will provide the basic needs; He will lift up and give value, and take care of tomorrow.Put God First and taste how sweet God is.</p>
