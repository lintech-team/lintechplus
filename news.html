  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
<p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>🕰️ Day 14 - April 9</p>
<p>📜 Purified through the Fire</p>

<p>“For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” Rom. 8:18</p>

<p>“Through trial and persecution the glory—the character—of God is revealed in His chosen ones. The believers in Christ, hated and persecuted by the world, are educated and disciplined in the school of Christ. On earth they walk in narrow paths; they are purified in the furnace of affliction. They follow Christ through sore conflicts; they endure self-denial and experience bitter disappointments; but thus they learn the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with abhorrence. Being partakers of Christ’s sufferings, they can look beyond the gloom to the glory, saying, ‘I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.’ Romans 8:18.” Acts of the Apostles, p. 576</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What is the glory that Romans 8:18 speaks of? Why are trials and suffering helpful to purify us? What have you learned about yourself through the trials of the recent weeks? Do you recognize weak spots in your character that you didn’t realize you had? How are you praying that God would grow you during this difficult time?</p>

<p>Day 14 - Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1. Pray for heavenly vision that we can see beyond the grave, beyond the pain and suffering and hardship of this life, to see the heavenly reward that awaits those that are faithful to the end.</p>

<p>2. Pray for wisdom for pastors and administrators as they seek to comfort and encourage and lead in the midst of chaos.</p>

<p>3. Pray for our children that are out of school, and especially for those who relied on the meals that they received at school. Pray that God would raise up caring Christians to find ways to feed them during this time of crisis.</p>

<p>4. Pray that God’s love would so fill us, so move us, so break our hearts afresh, that we could not contain it, but would share it with those who have no hope.</p>

<p>5. Pray that we will understand and actively share the message of “Righteousness by Faith” and that we will rest in the righteousness of Jesus.</p>

  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p> 
<p>🕰️ Day 13 - April 8</p>
<p>📜 OUR EYES ARE UPON YOU!</p>
<p>💡 Study Verse: “O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”(2 Chron. 20:12)</p>

<p>🔖 Read: “God would not have us remain pressed down by dumb sorrow, with sore and breaking hearts. He would have us look up and behold His dear face of love. The blessed Saviour stands by many whose eyes are so blinded by tears that they do not discern Him. He longs to clasp our hands, to have us look to Him in simple faith, permitting Him to guide us. His heart is open to our griefs, our sorrows, and our trials. He has loved us with an everlasting love and with loving-kindness compassed us about…Think of this, children of suffering and sorrow, and rejoice in hope. ‘This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.’ (1 John 5:4).” Thoughts from the Mount of Blessings, p. 12</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What does it mean to keep our eyes on Jesus? What happens sometimes when our eyes are blinded by tears? What is God longing to do? Just as God’s heart is open to our sorrows and grief, so our heart should be open to the sorrow and grief of others. How can we extend His arm of compassion and tender sympathy to those around us today?</p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1️⃣ Pray for those that are broken, for those that have recently lost loved ones, and for those struggling to feel that God is still near. </p>

<p>2️⃣ Pray for church members facing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic across the country of Canada. Pray for strength and peace, and healing. Pray for spiritual revival and that the gospel will advance throughout Canada as a result of these challenging times. </p>

<p>3️⃣ Pray for selfless love and giving to be the life of church members worldwide. Pray that those who have more resources would reach out and share with those who have less.</p>

<p>4️⃣ Pray that church members worldwide would put away their differences and come close in Christian fellowship, pleading for the Latter Rain.</p>

<p>5️⃣ Pray that church members worldwide would take personal responsibility for sharing the gospel with those around them even in the wake of large evangelistic events being canceled.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>🕰️ Day 12 - April 7</p>
<p>📜 Topic: GOD'S COVENANT WITH US</p>
<p>💡 Study Verse: “If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”(2 Chron. 7:14)</p>

<p>🔖Read: “The members of our churches need to be converted, to become more spiritual-minded. A chain of earnest, praying believers should encircle the world. Let all pray in humility. A few neighbors may meet together to pray for the Holy Spirit. Let those who cannot leave home, gather in their children, and unite in learning to pray together. They may claim the promise of the Saviour: ‘Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.’ ” Review and Herald, January 3, 1907, par. 4</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Based on 2 Chronicles 7:14 we see that God is looking for a heart of humility and repentance. Why is a spirit of humility so important when we pray? Why is united prayer important? How can we experience united prayer even while apart? </p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus (Day 12)</p>

<p>1️⃣ Pray that we would know as a church what it means to walk in humility before God and before each other. Pray that He would teach us how to pray, how to repent, and that healing would come as we seek God with all our hearts.</p>

<p>2️⃣ Pray that God would help us as a people know what it means to be more spiritually minded, and how to create a chain of prayer around the world.</p>

<p>3️⃣ Pray for church members living in the South England Conference in London. Pray that rather than this pandemic discouraging church members, there would be church growth, increased commitment to God and service.</p>

<p>4️⃣ Pray for our youth across Europe, to come back to church, and for parents to be strong positive role models by bringing their children to church. </p>

<p>5️⃣ Pray that every person, no matter their age, their gender, their official title or status, would recognize that they are to be witnesses and messengers of God’s love to a dying world.</p>

  <p>#100DaysOfPrayer</p>
<p>🕰️ Day 11 - April 6</p>
<p> 📜 Topic: GOD'S RAINBOW OF ASSURANCE</p>
<p>💡 Study Verse: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.”(Matt. 7:7-8)</p>

<p>🔖 Read: “The rainbow round about the throne is an assurance that God is true, that in Him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. We have sinned against Him, and are undeserving of His favor; yet He Himself has put into our lips that most wonderful of pleas, ‘Do not abhor us, for Thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of Thy glory; remember, break not Thy covenant with us.’ Jeremiah 14:21. When we come to Him confessing our unworthiness and sin, He has pledged Himself to give heed to our cry. The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His Word unto us.” Christ Object Lessons, p. 148 </p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>Reflect on the three different types of prayer as seen in Matthew 7:7-8. What is the significance of the rainbow around God’s throne? What is God’s pledge to us? What is staked against the honor of His throne? How does this give you confidence today?</p>

<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1️⃣ Pray for the ongoing health crisis throughout the United States and Europe. Pray that medical professionals can get the adequate supplies that are needed.</p>

<p>2️⃣ Pray for health professionals, security workers, and essential government service personnel across the United States and around the world who have contracted COVID-19 while in the line of duty and service to others. Pray for healing for them.</p>

<p>3️⃣ Pray for those living alone during this health pandemic, those struggling with fear, and those feeling the pain of isolation. Pray that they would discover they are not alone but that Jesus is right by their side.</p>

<p>4️⃣ Pray for all churches in your local region that may have been closed because of the virus. Pray that congregations will find ways to stay “together” through internet live-streaming and witnessing in appropriate “social distancing” ways, and that many more will be drawn to the truth because of this time of crisis.</p>

<p>5️⃣ Pray for that God would re-ignite fresh passion in the hearts of His people—fresh passion for His Word, for prayer, and for mission!</p>

<p>🕰️ Day 10 - April 5</p>
<p>📜 Topic: HIDDEN IN HIS TABERNACLE</p>

<p>💡 Study Verse: “For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.”_ (Psalms 27:5)</p>

<p>🔖 Read: “God will do great things for those who trust in Him. The reason why His professed people have no greater strength is that they trust so much to their own wisdom, and do not give the Lord an opportunity to reveal His power in their behalf. He will help His believing children in every emergency if they will place their entire confidence in Him and faithfully obey Him.” _Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 493_</p>

<p>Heart Questions:</p>
<p>What does it mean to be hidden in the secret of His tabernacle? Why do we as Christians have so little spiritual strength? What are two actions that God is waiting to see in us? How can we practice these two actions right now during our present crisis?</p>


<p>Calling on Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>Prayer Focus</p>

<p>1️⃣ Pray for church members in the country of Fiji who are seeking to be a light even in the midst of a world in chaos. Pray that they would be pillars of hope and anchors of stability in these difficult times, reflecting the love of Jesus with all they meet.</p>

<p>2️⃣ Pray for the local Hope station in Fiji to become a trusted media platform throughout the island and that God will use it to reach many for God’s kingdom.</p>

<p>3️⃣ Pray for the Student Missionaries around the world who are weathering the COVID-19 pandemic away from home and loved ones. Pray for courage and strength for our missionaries.</p>

<p>4️⃣ Pray for continued provision for those who are losing jobs, getting laid off, or wondering how to pay rent and utilities, and buy food when they can’t go to work.</p>

<p>5️⃣ Pray for church members in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other European countries who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus. Pray for comfort and strength to pick up and carry on.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Seven</p>
  <p>What type of faith do we need to have? And how are our greatest victories gained? Share with a loved one some 
  victories you have gained recently, or some victories that you need to gain. Pray for one another personally! </p>

  <p>“Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you and you shall glorify Me.” Ps. 50:15</p>

<p>“Jacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His experience testifies to the power of 
importunate prayer. It is now that we are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of unyielding faith. 
The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual Christian are not those that are gained by 
talent or education, by wealth or the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience 
chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power.” 
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 203</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Six</p>
  <p>We are all in a very serious battle. Doctors and nurses and medical professionals on the front line are especially 
  feeling the heat of this battle. How can we encourage them in their work? How are we to fight our battles? And what 
  is the holy calling that the church must awake to in the spiritual realm? </p>

<p>“As for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD shall save me. Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry 
   aloud, and He shall hear my voice. He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there 
   were many against me.” Ps. 55:16-18 </p>
 
<p>“When the church awakes to the sense of her holy calling, many more fervent and effective prayers will ascend to
   heaven for the Holy Spirit to point out the work and duty of God’s people regarding the salvation of souls. We 
  have a standing promise that God will draw near to every seeking soul.” 1 Selected Messages, p. 116 </p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p>Day Five</p>
  <p>We are told that the Holy Spirit will be given when we ask. We are also told that Heaven is waiting to give us 
this gift corporately as a church. So, what is heaven waiting for? Is heaven waiting for you and me? Could it be that
 we don't truly recognize our great spiritual need? Could it be that we've been content with a little of the Holy Spirit when 
God is longing to give us a full outpouring? </p>


<p>“If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father 
give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” Luke 11:13 </p>

<p>“The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the church is looked forward to as in the future; but it is the privilege of 
the church to have it now. Seek for it, pray for it, believe for it. We must have it, and Heaven is waiting to bestow it.” 
The Review and Herald, March 19, 1895</p>

  <p>Day Four</p>
  <p>What are some practical ways that we can combat fear? What about claiming Bible promises, singing songs, and 
reflecting on God's leading in our past? Share with someone a time when God carried you through a difficult trial and 
how your faith grew through that experience. As we reflect on His leading in the past, we will have renewed confidence 
for the future.</p>

<p>“Faith grows strong by coming into conflict with doubts and opposing influences. The experience gained in these trials is of more value than the most costly jewels.” Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 555</p>

  <p>"He (Christ) was nailed to the cross. The crowd, in whose hearts humanity seemed 
to be dead, sought to aggravate the cruel sufferings of the Son of God by 
their revilings. But as a sheep before 
His shearers is dumb, so He opened not 
His mouth. He was giving His life for the life of the world, that all who 
believed in Him should not perish.... Amidst this outbreak take heart and be
 of good courage for we know who holds our lives in His 
mighty hands. 🙏🏾" #NewlifeDailyHope</p>

  <h1>Stewardship Week of Prayer</h1>
    <p>You are welcome to this revival week. Summary of stewardship revival week message, God First, with sis Grace Otieno Day One</p>
     <p> 1. Irrefutable principles of stewardship:</p>
      <p>i) Ownership- God;</p>
      <p>ii) Responsibility- given to man;</p>
      <p>iii) Accountability - expected of man</p>
      <p>iv) Reward- by God to man.</p>
      <p>2. Areas to put God First: time; temple (body); talent and treasure.</p>
      <p>3. Good management of time, temple, applying talent gives treasure out of which tithe is returned to God and in appreciation of abundance, offering is given.</p>
      <p>4. God is first, its man who fails to recognise and acknowledge this. As a result, he/ she fears and worries about:</p>
      <p>i) basic needs;</p>
      <p>ii) personal worth/ value;</p>
      <p>iii) things beyond his/her control.</p>
      <p>5. Purpose to put God First in all spheres of life, He is mightily able; He will provide the basic needs; He will lift up and give value, and take care of tomorrow.Put God First and taste how sweet God is.</p>
