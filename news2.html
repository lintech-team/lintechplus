  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 78 - June 12 </p>
<p>üìú <strong>Time to Stop Worrying and Simply Trust</strong></p>

<p>When my first child was born, I read everything I could set my eyes on about anything that could go wrong within the first few months of his life. After all, they say, ‚Äúforewarned is forearmed,‚Äù right? He was a healthy full-term baby, with ten fingers, ten toes, and an excellent Apgar score. Yet as I looked upon his innocent face, I was suddenly struck with an unshakeable awareness of the fragility of life.</p>

<p>As my voracious reading progressed, I was introduced to SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) and I started down an internet rabbit hole. Each article I read, each personal story of losing a baby through SIDS served only to increase my anxiety about my inability to protect my little one. One moment I was reading an article counseling you to place nothing in the baby‚Äôs crib ‚Äî not a blanket, nor a stuffed animal ‚Äî because each item may lead to SIDS: The very next moment I would stumble upon a testimony from a mother who adhered to all the counsel offered to prevent SIDS but still woke up one morning to find her child lying lifeless in their crib.</p>

<p>What if that was my baby? What could I do differently to ensure that my family would never meet such a fate? Sleep was tiring as I would wake up at every movement, every coo, every change in breathing from my baby. As a loving wife who subscribes to the ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù motto, I shared my anxieties with my husband, and the first night that our son slept longer than six hours, my husband woke him up just to make sure he was still breathing. You get the picture ‚Äî we were a wretched ball of anxiety!</p>

<p>The more I thought about how powerless I was to protect my child from SIDS, the clearer it became to me how feeble all my efforts to secure the safety, protection, and welfare of my child were. In fact, I could not guarantee my own welfare, let alone that of a helpless baby!</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with a sense of my frailty, I turned to my mother, who turned me to Jesus. How did she do it? How can you ever rest again when there are so many mishaps to shield your child from?</p>

<p>The answer was simple: <strong>Trust in Jesus.</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúEvery time you put your child down to sleep, commit him into the hands of the God who never slumbers nor sleeps‚Äù, was her counsel. ‚ÄúTake him to the Lord in prayer and leave him there.‚Äù</p>

<p>My worrying about SIDS did not make my son any safer each night. It provided me with a false sense of ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù about my concern since I was expending much energy over it. But in reality, my worrying did nothing to help him breathe all night long.</p>

<p>So Jesus asked, ‚ÄúAnd which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?‚Äù (Matthew 6:27). Your worrying does not solve the problem, it does not ameliorate the situation. Quite the contrary. Rather than contributing something valuable to the circumstance, it clouds your judgment, diminishing your discernment, and renders you less capable of handling the stressor ‚Äì whatever the stressor may be.</p>

<p>You are worried about your finances. You are worried about your education. You are worried about your children. You are worried about your marriage. You are worried about your health. You are worried about the state of the world and the long-term effects of this COVID-19 pandemic. You are worried about the future and about where to go from here. You are worried about worrying too much. It never stops!</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what <strong>Ellen White</strong> has to say:</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen we take into our hands the management of things with which we have to do, and depend upon our own wisdom for success, we are taking a burden which God has not given us, and are trying to bear it without His aid. We are taking upon ourselves the responsibility that belongs to God, and thus are really putting ourselves in His place. We may well have anxiety and anticipate danger and loss, for it is certain to befall us. But when we really believe that God loves us and means to do us good we shall cease to worry about the future. We shall trust God as a child trusts a loving parent. Then our troubles and torments will disappear, for our will is swallowed up in the will of God.‚Äù ‚Äî <strong>Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 100, 101 (1896).</strong></p>

<p>In a sinful world, we can be sure that challenging situations will arise. Worldly wisdom says the best way to be prepared for any calamity is to educate ourselves as much as possible ‚Äî forewarned is forearmed. But when it comes to producing peace in the midst of the storm, knowledge is ineffective. The only forearming that is efficacious is to develop an abiding trust in the God who holds the minutest atom to the vast expanses of the universe in His hands. Thankfully, He is still in control!</p>

<p>Sikhu Daco is the Senior Editorial Assistant for inVerse ‚Äî a new young adult Bible study curriculum developed by the GC Sabbath School Department. For over a decade, she worked in secular campus ministry after receiving her BA in Biochemistry and French. She also holds a MA in Religion with an emphasis in Systematic Theology from Andrews University. As a panelist on Hope Channel‚Äôs inVerse Bible discussion show, she gets to engage in her two passions for Bible study and ministry to young adults. Sikhu and her husband, Archie, have three boys, ages 4, 2, and 9 months</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen we take into our hands the management of things with which we have to do, and depend upon our own wisdom for success, we are taking a burden which God has not given us, and are trying to bear it without His aid.

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Have you struggled with faith in times of crisis? Have you struggled with learning how to trust when all circumstances and all feelings seem to indicate that there is no good solution available for you? Why not ask God to give you more confidence and a stronger faith in His promises?</p>

<p><strong>ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE:</strong></p>
<p>Worry, anxiety, stress, these are natural reactions when we are faced with difficult, uncontrollable situations. Think about your life, and your family. What are some things that make you worry for them? What are scenarios that cause you to be fearful?</p>

<p>Now open your Bible and try to find scriptures and stories that promise you peace and strength from God. Read them, write them out, memorize them, and believe them. Is there really anything that our God cannot handle?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢<strong>Pastor H.:</strong> Thank you very much for your prayers! My cousin and his wife are better now.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ An individual gave a substantial donation to help literature evangelists around the world during this time of crisis. Literature evangelists are finding new and creative ways to reach people with spiritual books despite the lockdowns!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong><p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for more faith and truth in God, especially during this time of crisis.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for God‚Äôs blessing on members who are operating taxis in Panama City, using them as mobile centers of influence. Half of Panama‚Äôs citizens live in Panama City.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for the upcoming Adventist Women Ministries small group evangelism in the Western Nigeria Union.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for your immediate and extended family members. Pray for those who do not know Jesus as their personal Savior yet to be drawn to Him and be converted.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 77 - June 11</p>
<p>üìú <strong>EMPOWERED TO SERVE</strong></p>
<p>üí° <strong>Study Verse:</strong> ‚ÄúBut you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.‚Äù ‚Äì Acts 1:8</p>

<p>üîñ <strong>Read:</strong> ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs servants do not all possess the same gifts, but they are all His workmen. Each is to learn of the Great Teacher, and then to communicate what he has learned. All do not do the same work, but under the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit they are all God‚Äôs instrumentalities. God employs a diversity of gifts in His work of winning souls from Satan‚Äôs army.‚Äù ‚Äì Ye Shall Receive Power, p. 192</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>It is an exciting thing to participate in God‚Äôs work of drawing people to Jesus. You, with your talents, abilities and influence can be an agent of grace in this world! That‚Äôs fantastic! When your life is surrendered to God, and you are filled with the Spirit, He will empower you to do your part in the wonderful privilege of soul-winning! He will sanctify your skills and give you His spiritual gifts to accomplish whatever task He sets before you.</p>

<p>Will you today devote your life to the work of winning souls with Jesus? Will you trust that the Holy Spirit will empower you to do even seemingly impossible tasks? Will you ask Jesus to baptize you with the Spirit as you engage in reaching out to the world around you?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Mary F.:</strong> Our Church has been blessed in being united in prayer during 100 Days of Prayer. The Church feels the peace of God, and the church sees the mighty hands of God.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Ronald L.:</strong> During lockdown a small group consisting mostly of former Adventists and newly interested individuals were actively engaged in Bible study. As their district pastor, I met with that small group, leading in a revival worship service. At the end of the meeting we arranged for a foot washing and communion service and to our amazement a total of 52 members participated in the service of which, 60% of the participants were former and new members who accepted Jesus and made their bold covenant through communion service. I would like to Praise God for including Papua New Guinea in the 100 Days of Prayer on Day 57. God answered your prayers the next day May 23 by leading His lost sheep back to His fold. Praise God!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for churches in the Caribbean islands who on top of dealing with the pandemic now have to prepare for the 2020 hurricane season.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for the ministry of the Ellicott City Adventist Church, MD, USA, as they collect masks, gloves and goggles for medical personnel.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for the Setagaya Youth Church which is working to build relationships with the community around it. Please pray as youth and their leaders look for creative ways to serve their city.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for an Urban Center of Influence in San Jose, Costa Rica, which offers music and exercise classes, family counseling, Bible studies and more. Please ask God to bless this outreach and send the people who most need to know Him.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 76 - June 10 </p>
<p>üìú <strong>Topic: THE BEST GIFT! </strong></p>
<p>üí° <strong>Study Verse:</strong> _‚ÄúIf you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!‚Äù <strong>(Luke 11:13)</strong><p>

<p>üîñ <strong>Read:</strong> ‚ÄúThe Lord is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who serve Him than parents are to give good gifts to their children. For the daily baptism of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition to God.‚Äù ‚Äì <strong>[Acts of the Apostles, p. 50]</strong><p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong><p>
<p>The Father is very much willing to give you the Holy Spirit if you ask Him. God never forces Himself upon you; that is why you need to ask. The original Greek in Luke 11 indicates, that this asking is an ongoing, lifelong activity of seeking more of Him, of opening up your heart to God like a flower opens to the sun. Daily and continually we need to be immersed and filled with the Presence of God through His Spirit. God‚Äôs work of sanctification and character-preparation for eternity is a process. Every day He gives us new convictions, challenges and directions through His Word, and we need to daily invite His Spirit into our hearts for grace and ability to obey and to do His good will, loving others as He loves us.<p>

<p>You might have asked for the Holy Spirit before, but understanding that you need His baptism on a daily basis, will you ask for more of His presence in your life? Will you invite the Holy Spirit into every compartment of your heart without holding anything back?<p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong><p>
<p><strong>Luis U.:</strong> Me and my wife have been using Skype to study the Bible with six people during this quarantine. I invited many people to watch the special programs broadcasted by our Adventist channel in Brazil and many people who are not even Christians are now very open to the message of Our Lord! Some of my non-Christian friends have started to believe in the Second Coming of Christ!<p>

<p><strong>Winfrida M.:</strong> I want to share with you a word of encouragement that prayers are working! Last Sabbath five people were baptized in Kinshasa following the 100 Days of Prayer program which was shared through Radio, WhatsApp and other social media!<p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong><p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong>for members who are backsliding during this pandemic. Pray for the Holy Spirit to speak clearly into their hearts. Pray for those who can reach out to them to have courage, wisdom and love as they seek to help them come back to a faithful walk with Jesus.<p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for members in the West Zimbabwe Conference who are rallying to support the needy, vulnerable, elderly, and disabled in their communities.<p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for members and/or former members and youth who are trapped in false teachings and heresy. Pray for God to open their eyes and for the church to help them find the truth as it is in Jesus.<p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Pray</strong> for God‚Äôs protection over medical professionals at CHI Memorial Hospital Chattanooga, and other hospitals worldwide. </p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 75 - June 9 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.‚Äù ‚Äì Galatians 5:22-23</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs you receive the Spirit of Christ‚Äîthe Spirit of unselfish love and labor for others‚Äîyou will grow and bring forth fruit. The graces of the Spirit will ripen in your character. Your faith will increase, your convictions deepen, your love be made perfect. More and more you will reflect the likeness of Christ in all that is pure, noble, and lovely. . . . This fruit can never perish, but will produce after its kind a harvest unto eternal life.‚Äù ‚Äì Christ‚Äôs Object Lessons, p. 67-68</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>The Spirit leads us to Jesus. And as we abide in Jesus through a daily connection with the Holy Spirit, He will develop in us a character that reflects each day a little more the selfless, self-sacrificial, loving character of Christ. It is a transformational process of a lifetime. Just like a mango does not appear an hour after the seed has been planted but takes its time to grow into a tree that eventually bears fruit, so also the work of sanctification is a process that takes time. But rest assured that through surrender and faithfulness every aspect of the fruit of the Spirit will become evident in your life!</p>

<p>Have you let the Holy Spirit develop in you His fruit? Are there some aspects of the fruit of the Spirit which you have been resisting Him to work on? Is it your desire to reflect Jesus more and more until all that people see is Jesus‚Äô character of love in you?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Jones S.: I thank God for the 100 Days of Prayer. It has brought light into my life. I have started an Adventist bakery during this period and I'm spreading the Word of God through the bakery. Through the work of the Holy Spirit one of the people getting the messages has decided to become a Seventh-day Adventist. I thank God for showing me the many ways we can spread His word and hasten His coming!</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Brother P.: During the lockdown, I went through phases of questioning and each week, God allowed me to receive the answer to my questions through the different messages and experiences shared by the authors of the 100 Days of Prayer. Thank you, Lord, for your great love and for the moments of sharing that you allow us to have with the whole world.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for pastors, elders and lay preachers around the world who are engaging in various online evangelistic efforts.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Adventist church in Iceland. There are very few members and Iceland is a very secular country. Pray for a breakthrough, revival, and a mighty harvest for Jesus.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for an Adventist drug and alcohol rehab center in Guatemala‚Äôs capital city. In addition to finding freedom from addiction, more than 1,500 people have been baptized in nine years of ministry. Please ask God to continue to bless, provide, and change lives for eternity.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for an Adventist vegan restaurant in Byron Bay, Australia. It has been ranked number 1 in a popular Australian tourist spot. Please pray that God will bless this ministry and that He will work through it to reach hearts.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 74 - June 8 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.‚Äù ‚Äì John 16:8-11</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end. From the Day of Pentecost to the present time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To all who have accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a counselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness.‚Äù ‚Äì Acts of the Apostles, p. 49</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Part of the Holy Spirit‚Äôs work is to convict of sin, righteousness, and judgment. These three elements of His work of conviction are represented in the Sanctuary and its services. In the courtyard is where the sacrifice for sin took place (pointing to Jesus on the Cross); in the Holy Place the three elements of experiencing the imparted righteousness of Christ were revealed in the Table of Showbread (Bible study), the Altar of Incense (Prayer), and the Candlestick (Spirit-filled witnessing). All of which were exemplified in the life of Christ as a model for us today; and in the Most Holy Place we are reminded of the importance and reality of the judgment as the High Priest only entered it on the Day of Atonement (Jesus engaging in the investigative judgment on your behalf).</p>

<p>In other words: The Holy Spirit‚Äôs work is to lead you into a salvific experience through faith in everything that Jesus has done and is doing for you.</p>

<p>Can you see the important and beautiful work of the Holy Spirit? Will you joyfully embrace His work of conviction and let Him not only lead you to Jesus, but make you like Him in character in preparation for the Judgment?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ More and more churches have been able to upgrade their digital platforms to reach out and engage with the community online.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ John K.: It is amazing that during this terrible time, church members in our region have become more faithful in returning tithe and offerings. We met our tithe goal in May! We are praying morning and evening during the 100 Days of Prayer. It has not only planted but deepened the prayer culture in my home. Last night my 2 year old daughter called me at dawn and said "Daddy, it is time to pray!" I praise God and realize that He has planted what has been missing in my family ‚Äì a culture of prayer.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for many, young and old, who are struggling with media addictions.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for members in Perth, Australia who are evangelizing through letterboxing in the local community.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for baby Tyson, in New Zealand who is on life support. The doctors want to remove the life support, but we believe God is working as he has opened his eyes, making noises and moving his feet.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Adventist Life Hope Center in downtown Nazareth. It offers English, computer, and health classes. Ask God to bless and grow this ministry, to protect and guide workers and reach hearts.</p>

  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 73 - June 7 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.‚Äù ‚Äì John 16:13-14</p>

<p>‚ÄúThrough the Scriptures the Holy Spirit speaks to the mind, and impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He exposes error, and expels it from the soul. It is by the Spirit of truth, working through the Word of God, that Christ subdues His chosen people to Himself.‚Äù
‚Äì The Desire of Ages, p. 671</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Jesus is the Truth. He is the Personification of Truth. As the Creator He defined and established all reality in perfect harmony with His character of selfless love. Satan introduced falsehood and lies into the world, trying to establish a new reality of selfishness, which is really just a grand illusion leading to death. In order to escape the illusions of Satan we have been given the Word of God. The Holy Spirit is the One Who can open our eyes to all truths of the Bible as they are in Jesus. He is the One Who can lead us out of the illusions and into the light of Christ, Who is the Truth, the Word made flesh.</p>

<p>Will you let the Holy Spirit glorify Jesus in your life by leading you into the truth through His Word? Will you not only let Him reveal truth to you, but also let Him reform your heart into harmony with God‚Äôs reality of selfless love?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Vasantha P.: Because of this crisis I got much time for reading the Scriptures and taking notes, watching sermons, listening to spiritual songs. This has led to the happiest moments I have ever had!</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Carol D.: I am thanking God for his mercy and goodness. I have been a Seventh-day Adventist for 33 years, and this pandemic is a blessing for me, because I did not recognize the importance of health reform. God has been working on my heart. I have chosen to become a vegetarian. To God be the glory!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for churches that are struggling to go digital with their services due to a lack of technological equipment and internet services.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Adventist believers in Oman who are trying to obtain a space to gather for worship after the pandemic.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for families that are struggling with demonic oppression. Pray for victory over sins that might be the entrance for Satan to come and destroy.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for an Adventist house for homeless women in Leipzig, Germany. Over 25 years this ministry has served and supported around 2,000 women. Please ask God to continue to provide for this ministry, bringing hope and healing to those who need it most.</p>

<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúNevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.‚Äù ‚Äì John 16:7</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. . . . Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, . . . It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world‚Äôs Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His church. Of the Spirit Jesus said, ‚ÄòHe shall glorify Me.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì The Desire of Ages, p. 671</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever fully appreciated the incredible gift of the Holy Spirit? He is part of the Heavenly Trio, the Godhead, and He was sent to you as a gift from Jesus. He speaks, leads, convicts, helps, comforts, transforms and empowers you on your transformational journey of becoming more like our loving Jesus.</p>

<p>Are you comfortable in inviting the Holy Spirit into your life? Have you experienced Him ‚Äúmaking effectual what has been wrought out by the world‚Äôs Redeemer‚Äù?</p>

<p>Why not accept the gift of the Holy Spirit from Jesus and invite Him into your heart, giving Him access to every aspect of your life?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢Nicole P.: I‚Äôve seen my kids grow in their friendships with each other as they have played and worked together without friends. We‚Äôve had more time for both morning and evening family worships without anyone missing because of work or school. We‚Äôve gotten lots of things done in our home, all working together. And we‚Äôve had lots of great family conversations about end-time events.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Gabriel A.: I thank God for a special healing during these 100 Days of Prayer. Our Sabbath School song leader reported a strange illness in his leg. After prayers God healed him and he ministered the following Sabbath, May 23. Praise God!</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢Pray for members in Nigeria who are affected by persecution and harassment from various bandits and even local officials.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray for plans to build a lifestyle center in Puncak, West Java. A financial miracle is needed!</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray for Martina R. who has been fighting an auto-immune disease for two years. Her sickness has made it impossible for her to be engaged much in God‚Äôs work.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢Pray for the ‚ÄòOrigins‚Äô center in the Galapagos Islands. They are reaching tourists from cities around the world. Origins is the church‚Äôs first high-tech museum. Ask God to put His hand over it, to bring visitors, and to give staff the words He wants them to speak to guests.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 71 - June 5 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>When a Storm Catches You by Surprise!
<br>By Paul Dysinger</p>

<p>I was just putting our baby son Ethan down for a nap. It was a beautiful sunny day. Some clouds had just rolled over in the cool of the evening.</p>

<p>And then it hit. And it hit fast and hard.</p>

<p>Ethan had just fallen asleep when I heard my wife Natasha calling from the living room. I came out of the bedroom and looked out the window. And the first thing I noticed was the wind. It was blowing incredibly hard! And the sky was getting darker and darker.</p>

<p>Then we heard the tree limbs. Crash. Crack. Snap. They were literally breaking off of trees and slamming into the side of our house from the woods nearby. I looked out the other side of our cabin to see our greenhouse completely de-skinned. The entire plastic top had completely torn off. I grabbed my phone to check the weather, but the Internet was out.</p>

<p>"Honey, should we go?" I hear Natasha saying. "Yes - let's go," I responded.</p>

<p>We grabbed sleeping Ethan from off the bed and I threw my laptop into my backpack, then we darted for the car - spooked that at any moment a flying limb or falling tree could intercept our flight. We prayed as we flew along the dirt road up to my parent‚Äôs house where the basement would be a much safer place to wait out the storm. Already a tree had fallen across our driveway that we had to circumvent. Thankfully we could.</p>

<p>By now it was pouring rain. And so, through the blinding rain and raging wind we finally made it to the basement of my parents - and to safety. And here is the crazy thing. None of us saw it coming. No one. My uncle had been out on the tractor and had to ditch it and run inside. He also had a greenhouse that was de-skinned like ours and another one that faired a lot worse (looked like an elephant stepped on it). The storm hit us unexpectedly and we weren‚Äôt prepared.</p>

<p>Thankfully we are all safe and everyone is ok. But it still hit us unprepared. Kind of like how this whole COVID-19 pandemic hit our world unprepared. And here's the thing, we know there are more storms coming according to Bible prophecy. The question is, ‚ÄúHow are we preparing to weather those storms?‚Äù</p>

<p>Frankly, as a gardener you realize that you aren't in control of nature. The wind, the rain, the sun, the snow‚Äîyou simply can't control it. You can plan ahead and prepare for it if you have a good weather forecast. But sometimes things happen that we couldn't foresee. Then what?</p>

<p>I'll tell you what we do. We pray. We recognize that God is in control even when crazy things happen. And then we get up and keep going. When life comes crashing down around us, we‚Äôve got to get up and rebuild. The storms of life may knock us down - but we've got to reach out to the strength of God and move forward.</p>

<p>For us, our greenhouse was a small loss. Sure, it cost us a bit of cash and some time to fix. But within a few days we had the plastic back on - and this time we hope that we are more prepared, should such a situation occur again.</p>

<p>But what about the storms of life? What about the physical, emotional, spiritual, and economic storms created by COVID-19? How are you responding? How will you rebuild? What lessons are you learning that will prepare you for future storms? When things happen that are outside of your control, where do you turn for strength and comfort?</p>

<p>Jesus is our anchor and hope. We can turn to Him our Prince of Peace Who can calm storms with a word from His lips. We can turn to Him to bring us through the storms of life and even through the end times. Will you trust in Him today?</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.<br>Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is an everlasting rock.‚Äù ‚Äì Isaiah 26:3-4</p>

<p>Paul Dysinger and his wife Natasha live in Tennessee where they run a business in gardening and teaching people how to farm. (borntogrow.net)</p>

<p>Calling Upon Jesus in Our Urgent Need</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you. Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is an everlasting rock.‚Äù<br>‚Äì Isaiah 26:3-4</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>How have you reacted to the worldwide pandemic? How has this affected or not affected your faith in Jesus? Are you willing to trust in Him for the next unexpected storm in your life? Do you believe that Jesus can truly be your Everlasting Rock?</p>

<p><strong>ACTIVE HEART CHALLENGE:</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to show you any areas of your life where you might have not given Him full access to. Anything you might be unwilling to give up control over. Ask Him to forgive you and to help you trust in Him. Maybe this pandemic crisis has revealed to you some things in your life where you have been lacking to exercise faith. Pray to our loving Jesus to help you to surrender all to Him and to learn to trust in Him despite the storms of life.</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚òëÔ∏è Alex G.: Two great blessings! I had started a Bible study with a physician from my town. And because of COVID-19 we could study way more often than before. She accepted to be baptized even before visiting the church! I also was very blessed personally for, even though I had to cancel all my trips for the year, I could organize myself much better, so I could pray more, read my Bible more, write more and work more efficiently. In the midst of many sorrows came great blessings too!</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 70 - June 4 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:17-18</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe divine beauty of the character of Christ, of whom the noblest and most gentle among men are but a faint reflection; . . . Jesus, the express image of the Father‚Äôs person, the effulgence of His glory; the self-denying Redeemer, throughout His pilgrimage of love on earth, was a living representation of the character of the law of God. In His life it is made manifest that heaven-born love, Christlike principles, underlie the laws of eternal rectitude.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 49</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>The law of God is the law of love. Jesus revealed what keeping the law truly looks like. You can keep the law only by completely relying on the Holy Spirit for help. As you believe that He is going to help you to live a life of selfless love and as you by faith do actions of love, His divine power will enable you and work in you to will and do of His good pleasure.</p>

<p>If you are struggling with faithfulness to God‚Äôs law, will you ask Jesus today to forgive you, and fill you with His Holy Spirit? Will you ask Him to help you not just to keep the letter of the law, but the spirit of the law, which is selfless, sacrificial love to God and all people?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Marietta A.: ‚ÄúThank you for your prayers! My son has recovered from Covid-19 and is back to normal and healthy. Praise God!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ The mortality rate of the Covid-19 pandemic in Spain has decreased significantly from 11% to now just 2%.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the urban center of influence in Guatemala City which offers food, toothbrushes, showers, and a place to wash clothes for those who are living on the streets. Please ask God to meet the deepest needs of the visitors to this center, and to help them find hope for eternity.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the media, committed to providing up-to-date information concerning Covid-19. Pray that God will help them to communicate with appropriate seriousness.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who are struggling with anxiety, depression, and fear during this time of crisis. Pray that they will find help, courage, hope, and healing in Jesus.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for pastors, teachers, missionaries, and members in Laos. In some regions it is very hard to use technology to reach people to minister to during this pandemic and in-person visits are at times necessary to help individuals struggling with various issues.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 69 - June 3 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:14-16</p>

<p>‚ÄúHumanity has in itself no light. Apart from Christ we are like an unkindled taper, . . . But when we turn toward the Sun of Righteousness, when we come in touch with Christ, the whole soul is aglow with the brightness of the divine presence. Christ‚Äôs followers are to be more than a light in the midst of men. They are the light of the world . . . Angels of glory wait to communicate through you heaven‚Äôs light and power to souls that are ready to perish.‚Äù<br>‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 40</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Did you read the quote above? Do you realize that angels are waiting to work through you to reach lost people? Isn‚Äôt this amazing?</p>

<p>You are invited to not only be filled with the Holy Spirit for your personal sanctification, but to actively participate in shining the truth, love, and righteousness of Jesus to a world whose time is running out.</p>

<p>Think about your family, your friends, your neighbors, your co-workers. Ask God to show you who needs the light of Jesus in their life? Who should you pray for and contact this week?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 67 - June 1 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:11-12</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn every age God‚Äôs chosen messengers have been reviled and persecuted, yet through their affliction the knowledge of God has been spread abroad. Every disciple of Christ is to step into the ranks and carry forward the same work, knowing that its foes can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. God means that truth shall be brought to the front and become the subject of examination and discussion, even through the contempt placed upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated; every controversy, every reproach, every effort to restrict liberty of conscience, is God‚Äôs means of awakening minds that otherwise might slumber.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 33</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When persecution comes, when your reputation is being slandered, when your life could be in danger, then Jesus‚Äô love and truth will shine the brightest. How you react, what you say, what you do when faced with these pressures, will greatly determine the impact your faithfulness can have on those who seek to ruin your life.</p>

<p>Why not ask Jesus to help you to be faithful and loving today and everyday so that you are able to show that same love even under persecution?</p>

<p>Will you pray to Him even now and ask Him to make you a true Christian who will stand for Jesus though the heaven‚Äôs fall?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORT:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pastors, church workers, teachers, and evangelistic initiatives around the world are struggling financially due to the decrease in tithes and offerings. But they are putting their trust in the God of miracles. God is opening many doors for even greater ministry to people with less resources than before.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Warwick Seventh-day Adventist Church‚Äôs mobile soup kitchen in Sydney, Australia, which serves up soup and is connecting with lonely people in their area. Please ask God to help them build connections in the community.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the new medical school for East Africa in Kigali, Rwanda. Pray for the students who graduate from it, and the people they serve.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the rebuilding of the South Philippine Adventist College church which was destroyed in an earthquake in December 2019.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a center of influence in the midst of a Muslim community in an unnamed city. Some of the Muslims have requested prayer for them during this Covid-19 crisis. They believe that Adventist‚Äôs prayers are heard by God.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 66 - May 31 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:10</p>

<p>‚ÄúJesus does not present to His followers the hope of attaining earthly glory and riches, and of having a life free from trial, but He presents to them the privilege of walking with their Master in the paths of self-denial and reproach, because the world knows them not.‚Äù
‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 29</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When selfless-love, righteousness, holiness, and truth is being revealed by faithful Christians, Satan will arouse resistance and hatred amongst those who choose to ignore the Holy Spirit‚Äôs voice. We can have the assurance that in all persecution we might face, Jesus will be with us and will be glorifying Himself through our challenging experience.</p>

<p>Have you experienced persecution because of your faithfulness to Jesus? Why, or why not?</p>

<p>Will you choose today to cast off any desire to please the world, and prayerfully focus on revealing God‚Äôs glory, even if that might result in persecution?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Many churches are becoming creative in conducting their Sabbath services while physical distancing.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ The pandemic has brought the importance of our health message to the forefront of members around the world. The interest in preventative health work, NEWSTART, etc. is growing. Now is a wonderful time to lead people to a comprehensive understanding of God‚Äôs laws of health and wholeness.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the ministry of Norway‚Äôs oldest Adventist church, now adding a center of influence to provide free Norwegian classes for migrants, a cooking school, a conversation caf√©, and more.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the ministry of two new mobile health vans in Chiapas, Mexico. Pray for the patients they transport and the weekend medical brigades they support, making possible free medical checkups, minor surgeries, dental procedures, ultrasounds checks, eye exams and more.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a revival of true godliness and a renewed interest in evangelism in each member and church around the world.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the church in Burundi. It is going through various struggles and issues at this time. Only God‚Äôs intervention can bring peace.</p>

<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:9</p>

<p>‚ÄúChrist is ‚Äòthe Prince of Peace‚Äô (Isaiah 9:6), and it is His mission to restore to earth and heaven the peace that sin has broken. ‚ÄòBeing justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.‚Äô Romans 5:1. Whoever consents to renounce sin and open his heart to the love of Christ, becomes a partaker of this heavenly peace.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 27</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Salvation in Jesus gives us perfect peace. But Jesus is not calling us to only experience peace with God through a surrender of your life to Him. No, He also calls you to become an agent of peace ‚Äì a peacemaker. In this time of crisis, will you choose to be such an agent of peace? Will you do all you can to shine the peace of God ‚Äì His presence of love ‚Äì into the lives of those around you who live in anxiety and fear?</p>

<p>If you have been the cause of strife and disputes in your family or church, will you seek forgiveness and spread God‚Äôs peace?</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the Rwenzori region in Uganda, which has been hit by floods multiple times in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 64 - May 29 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚Äú. . . however trifling this or that wrong act may seem in the eyes of men, no sin is small in the sight of God. Man‚Äôs judgment is partial, imperfect; but God estimates all things as they really are. The drunkard is despised and is told that his sin will exclude him from heaven; while pride, selfishness, and covetousness too often go unrebuked. But these are sins that are especially offensive to God; for they are contrary to the benevolence of His character, to that unselfish love which is the very atmosphere of the unfallen universe. He who falls into some of the grosser sins may feel a sense of his shame and poverty and his need of the grace of Christ; but pride feels no need, and so it closes the heart against Christ and the infinite blessings He came to give.‚Äù (Steps to Christ, p. 30)</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Marlynn W.: ‚ÄúWe praise the Lord that during the 100 Days of Prayer for the pandemic God has secured us with jobs, food, and shelter. The Lord has also convicted us to move out to the countryside. Additionally, He has given me an opportunity to witness to the Muslim community.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Moses M.: ‚ÄúThank you to for praying for us. The Lord has heard your prayers! It is amazing! During the national lockdown period in Namibia, about 1100 people have enrolled in studying Bible lessons, 70% of which are not Seventh-day Adventists.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for students around the world who are unable to work due to the lockdowns. Pray that God will provide them with the financial means to pay for tuition.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for victims of domestic violence around the world.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the family of Alexander Ostankin, a pastor who was murdered as he was ministering. Pray that God will turn the blood of this martyr into the seed of the gospel.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for those who are currently struggling with Covid-19. Pray for their full recovery.</p>

<p>Weekly devotional: <strong>The Beauty in Brokenness</strong>
_by Melody Mason_</p>

<p>I will never forget, a number of years ago, as I was preparing to lead a prayer service for a large event, how the Holy Spirit convicted me of something specific in my life that I needed to make right with God. Overwhelmed, I sank to my knees on the floor that night as I prayed, ‚ÄúOh Lord, please forgive me...‚Äù</p>

<p>However, while I confessed my sin to God, certain steps were necessary to make proper amends. But I couldn‚Äôt take these steps immediately, so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do. Should I still go forward with my prayer ministry responsibilities or should I get someone else to fill in for me until I had made things right?</p>

<p>As a respected leader in ministry, it was very humiliating to think of admitting to others that I had failed God in a specific area. I didn't want to make a stir and appear spiritually weak to my teammates, or to the many strangers that were in attendance at the meetings. So, with a heavy heart and tears in my eyes, I went to sleep that night, determined that I would just ask someone else to lead the prayer service the next day.</p>

<p>However, the next morning as I set out to find someone to take my place, God stopped me in my tracks as the Holy Spirit began speaking to my heart. "Melody, you need to lead the prayer service this morning. Don‚Äôt get someone to replace you!‚Äù
‚ÄúWait God‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt mean this?‚Äù I said as fresh tears came to my eyes. But the Holy Spirit continued to speak to my heart.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I want you to lead, however, you are not to lead it as the person you want everyone to think you are. Don‚Äôt you see? I‚Äôm not looking for people to lead who cover up their sins and go on as if everything is okay. I‚Äôm looking for yielded broken vessels; vessels that will humble themselves to such a degree that pride is gone. Only then can I really use them for My glory. I know this hurts, but you need to share with the congregation what I convicted you of last night. Be honest about how you‚Äôve failed Me! Then invite them to come with you to the cross to put away all sin and compromise. You see, if people wait to come until they have everything in order, they will never come.‚Äù</p>

<p>Again, I began to protest. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this, Lord! What will everyone think when they see how I‚Äôve failed You?‚Äù</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit spoke softly to my heart as He turned my eyes toward heaven. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter what they think. This is not about protecting your reputation. This is about bringing glory to God. But, if He is to work, you must humble yourself.‚Äù</p>

<p>Oh, how I did not want to obey the Holy Spirit‚Äôs promptings that morning. If I could have run away like Jonah, or crawled in a cave, I would have done so immediately. But I knew what I must do. I had to obey.</p>

<p>Shaking and with tears in my eyes, I went before hundreds of people that morning and shared what the Lord had laid on my heart. You could have heard a pin drop in the room as everyone listened. ‚ÄúJesus tells us to come as we are,‚Äù I said softly, as I continued to the wipe tears away from my eyes. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm coming as I am and I‚Äôm inviting you to join me at the foot of the cross.‚Äù</p>

<p>At this invitation everyone got out of their chairs and came forward to the front of the room. There was soft weeping here and there as different people asked God‚Äôs forgiveness for those areas of sin and compromise that had crept into their lives. And the Holy Spirit was there. In the book Steps to Christ we are told:</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf you see your sinfulness, do not wait to make yourself better. How many there are who think they are not good enough to come to Christ. Do you expect to become better through your own efforts? ‚ÄòCan the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.‚Äô Jeremiah 13:23. There is help for us only in God. We must not wait for stronger persuasions, for better opportunities, or for holier tempers. We can do nothing of ourselves. We must come to Christ just as we are.‚Äù (Steps to Christ, p. 31)</p>

<p>In hindsight, I think this was one of the most sweet, sacred prayer services I‚Äôve ever experienced, for God did a deep work of cleansing among all of us that morning. Many hearts were broken, but how beautiful and healing the brokenness was. In Psalm 51:17 the Bible tells us, ‚ÄúThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, A broken and a contrite heart‚ÄîThese, O God, You will not despise.‚Äù</p>

<p>What offering are you seeking to bring to God these days? Is it your best works, your best prayers, your best attempts to be a strong witness even in the midst of life-shattering events? Our best offering has nothing to do with our works, but is the complete brokenness of self, of pride and all self-sufficiency as we come to the foot of the cross. As the famous hymn Rock of Ages says so beautifully, ‚ÄúNothing in my hand I bring, simply to thy cross I cling.‚Äù Let‚Äôs cling to that cross today!</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 63 - May 28 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:8</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Holy Spirit takes the truth concerning God and Him whom He hath sent, and opens it to the understanding and to the heart. The pure in heart see God in a new and endearing relation, as their Redeemer; and while they discern the purity and loveliness of His character, they long to reflect His image. They see Him as a Father longing to embrace a repenting son, and their hearts are filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory.‚Äù
‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, p. 26</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When we faithfully walk with God, He continually opens our eyes to more and more of an understanding of His character of love, His will, and His beauty. In the realization of His perfect holiness and purity our impurities come to light and we are invited to receive the cleansing only He can give. On this side of heaven, we see with the eye of faith, but one day soon, we shall see Him face to face! That will be a glorious day.</p>

<p>Until then, why not ask Him to cleanse our hearts from all impurity and filth? Why not actively search for an ever-clearer vision and understanding of our God and His will?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Shana S.: ‚ÄúDuring the 100 Days of Prayer I started praying for a friend of 20 years who, out of the blue, started to ignore me in 2017. Blocked me on her phone, etc. I had tried to reach out many times. No response. Our prayer leader encouraged us to cry out to God. I did. I called again. No response. The next day she called me back! She unblocked me and told me that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. We reconnected and reconciled. God answers our prayers!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ John K.: ‚ÄúHere in Uganda the lockdown has left many starving. During a 100 Days of Prayer session, God gave me wisdom to help the starving children. I sent a message to 100 families from church and asked them to share food with starving people near them. This simple idea spread across the entire region through a journalist who shared it online. With the new connections we made we now started WhatsApp based evangelistic meetings!‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for a pure heart, free from sin, cleansed from all impurity.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for funeral directors, morticians, embalmers and funeral service staff as they are in direct contact with many who have died of Covid-19.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the church in Fiji, as they are considering structural changes and stronger empowerment of the laity in taking ownership of various responsibilities.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for the ministry of the Harvest Seventh-day Adventist Church in Alabama, USA. They are located in a low income, high crime area, and have seen very little fruit in their soul-winning efforts. Pray for God to bring a breakthrough.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 62 - May 27 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:7</p>

<p>‚ÄúGod is Himself the source of all mercy. His name is ‚Äòmerciful and gracious.‚Äô Exodus 34:6. He does not treat us according to our desert. He does not ask if we are worthy of His love, but He pours upon us the riches of His love, to make us worthy. He is not vindictive. He seeks not to punish, but to redeem . . . He yearns with intense desire to relieve the woes of men and to apply His balsam to their wounds . . . The merciful are ‚Äòpartakers of the divine nature,‚Äô and in them the compassionate love of God finds expression. All whose hearts are in sympathy with the heart of Infinite Love will seek to reclaim and not to condemn. Christ dwelling in the soul is a spring that never runs dry. Where He abides, there will be an overflowing of beneficence.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, p. 22</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Take a moment and think about God‚Äôs mercy upon your life. He only looks out for your best, despite your unfaithfulness. He is not requiring you to prove your worth to Him in order to receive His gift of salvation. He treats you with love.</p>

<p>When you experience and internalize God‚Äôs mercy, the Holy Spirit will enable you to become an agent of mercy; treating those around you with the same kind of love and mercy. Especially those who have wronged you.</p>

<p>Will you choose today, with the help of Jesus, to extend God‚Äôs mercy to people in your life? Forgiving them before they ask for it, loving them before being given a reason to? Desiring their best no matter if they are worth it or not?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Elham L.: ‚ÄúI have been asking God for a deeper relationship with him. Since incorporating the 100 Days of Prayers on a daily basis into my daily devotions using a prayer journal my prayer life has been revitalized. It‚Äôs mind-blowing!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Sherma J.: ‚ÄúGod answered a prayer for a missing member. She ignored my attempts to call her. When I visited, she would just talk about her problems and not let me say anything. I prayed for God to work on her heart and instead of me trying to call her that she would call me. Two weeks later she called and said that her problems are gone and she wants to come back to church and recommit her life to God!‚Äù</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 61 - May 26 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.‚Äù
‚Äì Matthew 5:6</p>

<p>‚ÄúRighteousness is holiness, likeness to God, and ‚ÄòGod is love.‚Äô 1 John 4:16. It is conformity to the law of God, for ‚Äòall Thy commandments are righteousness‚Äô (Psalm 119:172), and ‚Äòlove is the fulfilling of the law‚Äô (Romans 13:10). Righteousness is love, and love is the light and the life of God. The righteousness of God is embodied in Christ. We receive righteousness by receiving Him.‚Äù‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, p. 18</p>

<p>HEART QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>Do you hunger and thirst for Christ‚Äôs righteousness?</p>

<p>His life of perfect selfless love and His substitutional death provides you with a twofold gift of justifying grace: 1.) His imputed righteousness, which is the promise that you are covered by His perfect life through faith in that promise. 2.) His imparted righteousness, which is the promise that He will transform you from a being of selfishness, into a being that reflects the selfless love of Jesus, through living faith in that promise.</p>

<p>This twofold gift will fulfill you; it will truly satisfy you; it will save you! Why not accept it today and start living a happy and Jesus-filled life in the awareness of this amazing reality of God‚Äôs redemptive love?</p>

<p>PRAISE REPORTS:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Jane D.: ‚ÄùGod healed the sick who I prayed for. He also amazingly touched the hearts of my family.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Marcia N.: ‚ÄúMy daughter has been addicted to drugs for many years, was homeless and even went to jail. Our prayer group started praying for her and as a result she is now in a facility getting help, her health is improving, she has a renewed interest in God, and she is reading Spirit of Prophecy books. She said that it is God who helped her. I praise God for His love for us and helping us through these heartbreaking years. Weeping endures for a night, but JOY comes in the morning!‚Äù</p>

<p>PRAYER REQUESTS:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for Christ‚Äôs righteousness to cover and fill you.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for God to intervene in the outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis in the upper west region of Ghana. This outbreak has already killed many people in that region.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for churches that have become inactive since the Covid-19 outbreak. Pray for pastors, church leaders, and members to know how to best connect at this time. Pray for a new focus on the importance of prayer.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Pray for members in Myanmar as they utilize the internet to spread the gospel in this time of crisis.</p>

  <h1>100 Days of Prayer.</h1>
  <p><strong>#100DaysOfPrayer</strong></p> 
<p>üï∞Ô∏è Day 60 - May 25 </p>
<p>üìú </p>
<p>‚ÄúBlessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:5</p>

<p>‚ÄúHuman nature is ever struggling for expression, ready for contest; but he who learns of Christ is emptied of self, of pride, of love of supremacy, and there is silence in the soul. Self is yielded to the disposal of the Holy Spirit. Then we are not anxious to have the highest place. We have no ambition to crowd and elbow ourselves into notice; but we feel that our highest place is at the feet of our Saviour. We look to Jesus, waiting for His hand to lead, listening for His voice to guide.‚Äù ‚Äì Thoughts from The Mount of Blessing, p. 15</p>

<p><strong>HEART QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>There is no happier place in life than knowing that you are in harmony with God in all you do. This harmony exists when Jesus is sought after, and the exaltation of self is abandoned, recognizing that the sinful ‚Äúheart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick.‚Äù (Jeremiah 17:9). Humility, meekness, is the key to letting the Holy Spirit develop in you a truly beautiful, Christ-like character.</p>
<p>Will you ask Jesus to take away your prideful desires, your self-centered ambitions, and your love of supremacy? Will you ask Him to replace them by enabling you to practice gentleness, meekness, and humility, starting today?</p>

<p><strong>PRAISE REPORTS:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Claudia P.: ‚ÄúI praise God for His tender mercies are new not only every morning, but every moment! He has been good toward my family and me beyond what words can express. I praise you Lord!‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Rose K.: ‚ÄúPraise God for the 100 Days of Prayer! Every day I am prompted to do something new, or I see new changes in other believers. Afterward, I realize that what I saw was actually an answer to the prayer request in the 100 Days of Prayer. It is amazing to see how the Holy Spirit is working!‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>PRAYER REQUESTS:</strong></p>
