                or operating rules posted by us on the App or in respect to the App constitute the
                entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or
                enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver
                of such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent
                permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others
                at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or
                failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision
                or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or
                unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from
                these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any
                remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
                relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of
                the App. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by
                virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have
                based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the
                parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.</div>&nbsp;
